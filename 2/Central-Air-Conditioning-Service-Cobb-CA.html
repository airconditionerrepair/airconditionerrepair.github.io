<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers contaminants from indoor air (revealed as a portion performance rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (expressed in cubic feet per minute). An extremely efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-lasting efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon keeping it according to the maker's directions.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the very same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes.

You get immediate, real-time access to the monitoring results through a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are simple to decipher.<p>
