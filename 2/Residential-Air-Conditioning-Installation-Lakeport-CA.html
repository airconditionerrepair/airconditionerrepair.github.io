<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
