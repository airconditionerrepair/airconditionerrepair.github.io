<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to maintain the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, select your contractor wisely, a number of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a reputable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Think about potential results of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system. Follow the producer's instructions, especially instructions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater correctly changed. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is normally a sign of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While an area heating unit is in use, open a door from the room where the heater lies to the rest of the home and open a window a little.<p>
