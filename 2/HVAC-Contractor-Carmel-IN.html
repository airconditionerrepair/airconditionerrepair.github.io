<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The cost for heatpump installation likewise depends upon the size of the unit and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house units, on the other hand, range in rate from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation.
