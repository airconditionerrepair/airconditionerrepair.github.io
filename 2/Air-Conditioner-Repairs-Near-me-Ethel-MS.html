<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Ethel MS</h3>
<p>Among the main factors a furnace will run continuously is since something is stopped up or dirty Before trying to repair any problem, take time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". If the air filter is great to go, check the furnace blower for obstructing and tidy it. Have an appearance at the furnace blower motor and lube it if this does not work. Contact a knowledgeable technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>Both should be kept tidy since an air conditioner moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise necessary to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
