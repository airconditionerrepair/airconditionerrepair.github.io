Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Commercial HVAC in Allerton IL</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance products that only a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in costly compressor failure, however a homeowner doesn't have the tools or abilities required to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and appropriate air flow are important to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the required equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still essential to have an expert technician check the system regularly.<p>
