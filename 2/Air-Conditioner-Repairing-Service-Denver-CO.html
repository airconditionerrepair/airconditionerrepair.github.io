<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it might flatter twice the electrical power that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to offer a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed simply a couple of years ago.<p>
<p>Air conditioning unit can develop a lot of water since they remove moisture from the air. To get rid of this, they have a generally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To deal with condensate issues, please see A/c Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
