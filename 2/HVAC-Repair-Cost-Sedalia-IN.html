Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
