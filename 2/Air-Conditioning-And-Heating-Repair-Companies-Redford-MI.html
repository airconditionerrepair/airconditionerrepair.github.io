<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, rather than commercial or outside settings. In tasks where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It might also consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to individual spaces.<p>
<p>Fact: Federal and local rewards usually total up to between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can often make the preliminary price of a system competitive with traditional devices.

Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. However, new installation practices are reducing expenses, to the point where the cost is getting closer to standard systems under the right conditions.<p>
