Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up, do not accept them until they have been effectively dried. If items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
