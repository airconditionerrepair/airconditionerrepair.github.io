<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce contaminants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by people and animals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
