<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Underfloor heating is easy to install, especially if you make it part of a build or renovation job.

Plus, there's even an included cleaning convenience as keeping the spaces dust-free is easier without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>
