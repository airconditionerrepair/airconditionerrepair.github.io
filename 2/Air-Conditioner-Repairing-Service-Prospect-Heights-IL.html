<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too.
