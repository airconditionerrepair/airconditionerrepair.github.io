Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
