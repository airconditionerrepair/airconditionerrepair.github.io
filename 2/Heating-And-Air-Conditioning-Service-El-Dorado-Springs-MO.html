<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
