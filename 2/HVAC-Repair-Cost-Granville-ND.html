The copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil.

If you found that your conditioning filter requires replacing, then the next step is to defrost your a/c equipment.
