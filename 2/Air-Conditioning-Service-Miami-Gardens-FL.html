<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to offer sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical element needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
