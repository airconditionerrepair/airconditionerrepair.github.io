<p>Self-installation tends to create more issues than it resolves. In fact, it often prompts expert intervention anyway to correct some of the issues that were created during the installation. Don't set yourself up for the headache of calling an HVAC company anyhow after investing so much time trying to prevent it. Let G & S Heating Cooling & Electric handle the whole HVAC installation process from the beginning, and you'll never ever need to fret about it being done improperly.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are clogged, the compressor can overheat and shut down. You'll experience intermittent periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them again. Switch off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the detach block (Photo 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Image 2). If the air conditioning service still does not work effectively after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, set up a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC will not work completely unless you do this.<p>
<p>You might upgrade to the greatest performance gear readily available and still not feel easily cool on hot days. That's since the mechanicals are just part of the central air system.

Before choosing whether to repair or change your condenser and blower systems, your technician ought to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining how much air escapes the system.<p>
