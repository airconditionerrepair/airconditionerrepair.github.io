<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.

<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
