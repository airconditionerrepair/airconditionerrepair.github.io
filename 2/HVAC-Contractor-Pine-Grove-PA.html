<h3>Things to Think about when Buying a Heat Pump in Pine Grove PA</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on numerous house effectiveness upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took adequate time to help us discuss which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings. We never felt hurried and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's services and products was excellent. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a sensible level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to carry out the necessary electrical enhancements to save on cost.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: They were excellent! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially requested. They fulfilled my needs completely by supplying a professional quote with choices, without pressing additional items. The team appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The also promptly followed up with the needed examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have issues.
