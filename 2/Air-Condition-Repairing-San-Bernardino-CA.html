<p>. Prior to selecting the installation area of a/c, a number of primary factors require to be considered. To start with, the direction of air flow from the indoor systems must not fall on the location of rest or workspace. Second of all, there should not be any barriers en route of the airflow that might prevent it from covering the space of the facilities as much as possible.
