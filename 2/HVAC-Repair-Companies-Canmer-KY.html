If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are higher year after year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be wasting money by not replacing the older system.<p>
