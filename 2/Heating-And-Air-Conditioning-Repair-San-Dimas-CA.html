<h3>HVAC Repair Free Estimates in San Dimas CA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>We look at hints prior to we provide advice to change instead of repair a heating unit. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy.
