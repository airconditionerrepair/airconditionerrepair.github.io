<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

<h3>The Way to Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Swansboro NC</h3>
<p>Employers are required to follow the General Responsibility Stipulation of the OSHAct, which requires them to offer workers with a safe office that does not have any known hazards that cause or are most likely to cause death or major injury. The OSHAct also requires companies to obey occupational safety and health standards developed under it. Employers must be fairly knowledgeable about the possible sources of bad air quality, and they should have the resources essential to recognize and manage workplace risks. It is likewise their obligation to notify staff members of the instant threats that are present.Specific state and local guidelines might apply.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
