<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ may discover undesirable or musty odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues.

<p>A packaged system, typically installed on the roofing system, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for house owners to consider. Many times, these units consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system individually, because the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are generally only readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best alternative for property owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
