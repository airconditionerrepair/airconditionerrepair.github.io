<h3>Gas Furnace Service in La Mirada California</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, however to have two significant elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply eight to ten years old, it could suck up to twice the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's due to the fact that it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to supply a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than devices installed simply a couple of years back.<p>
<p>If your a/c unit is old, think about purchasing an energy-efficient design. Look for the ENERGY STAR ® and EnergyGuide labels - certified central units are about 15% more effective than basic designs. New residential central air conditioning conditioner requirements entered into impact on January 1, 2015; see the effectiveness requirements for central air conditioning conditioners for information, and consider acquiring a system with a greater SEER than the minimum for greater cost savings.<p>
