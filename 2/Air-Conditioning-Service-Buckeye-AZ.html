<p>Specialist heating system installations. However, even the best-maintained heating unit will eventually stop working. HVAC professionals suggest following this standard rule when deciding whether it's worth buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a brand-new system, it's best to buy new.
