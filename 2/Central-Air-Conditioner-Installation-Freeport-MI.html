It's an obscure truth that the quality and tidiness of your air ductwork is just as crucial as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will often build up in ductwork, restricting airflow. Since ductwork is so complex, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can seem really daunting initially, requiring specialized tools, equipment, and knowledge.

<p>It might just require to be cleaned if your central air conditioner will not cool but you can hear it running. Whether this is the cause of the problem, it's a great early remedy to try.

Keep in mind: Constantly turn off the power prior to cleaning the system.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the go to. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a quick internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning.
