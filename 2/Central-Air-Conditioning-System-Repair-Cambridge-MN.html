<h3>Air Condition Repairing in Cambridge MN</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me regarding an uncommonly high costs that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had actually called the service supervisor and left a message of issue. Ron had identified the trouble area in examining the costs. He dealt with the problem in one day, had adjusted the costs to what I considered reasonable prior to he called back, understood what might have triggered the problem and had a strategy to guarantee that it would not take place again. I have thought about All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have actually utilized them. This experience verifies that.<p>
