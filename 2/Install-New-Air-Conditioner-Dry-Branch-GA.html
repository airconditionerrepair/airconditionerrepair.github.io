<p>Appropriate ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same contaminants.

<p>Geothermal heatpump, in addition to all other kinds of heatpump, have actually efficiencies ranked according to their coefficient of performance, or POLICE. It's a scientific way of identifying how much energy the system moves versus how much it utilizes. Many geothermal heat pump systems have Polices of 3.0 to 5.0. This implies for each system of energy used to power the system, 3 to 5 systems are supplied as heat.<p>
