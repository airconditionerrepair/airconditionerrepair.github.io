<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year.
