Everyone we spoke to from starting to end were really expert, courteous and the work was extremely effectively done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
