<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the task based just on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of affordable ones got. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex priced estimate for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex properly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up group was respectful of my house and installed the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post install inspection results look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 system it replaced (also Provider).<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day.
