<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future.

<h3>Heating System Installation in Pelahatchie MS</h3>
<p>All heating unit have some level of air filtering. From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some basic maintenance. These filters assist with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne contaminants streaming through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping in reducing the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from building up on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
