<p>Today's house radiant heat systems maximize infrared radiation. By far, the most common source of a radiator in a home is the floor mass. Radiators can be locally situated in one location like a bathroom floor or be installed across the entire sub-surface of the home's floorings. Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating units-- although ceiling radiators are generally utilized in commercial applications like storage facilities.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, but it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a space or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising expensive-- which can have a negative impact on residents-- outside air should be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
