<h3>Methods To Get the Most From Your HVAC System at Sammamish WA</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions call for.

Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
