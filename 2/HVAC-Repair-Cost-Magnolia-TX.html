<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same. Once the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up.

It's a structure to guide the launch or revamp of your service that you can build upon and restructure as the business evolves.<p>
