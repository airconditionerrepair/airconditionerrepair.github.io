Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The decreased air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers.
