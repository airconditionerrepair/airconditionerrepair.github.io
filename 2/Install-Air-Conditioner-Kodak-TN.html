You may also be tracking in lead from soil around your house. Soil very close to houses might be infected from lead paint on the outside of the structure. Soil by roads and highways may be infected from years of exhaust fumes from automobiles and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to wipe your feet prior to getting in the house. Change your clothing before you go house and wash these clothing separately if you work with lead in your task or a hobby.
