<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Santa Clarita CA Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>Co2 (CO2) is a relatively simple to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants discharged by human beings, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are abnormally high indoors may trigger occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of co2 in a lot of structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they give me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
