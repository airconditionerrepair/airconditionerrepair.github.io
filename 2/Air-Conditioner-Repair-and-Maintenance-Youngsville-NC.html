<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
