Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion procedure. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively straightforward process. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite pricey.<p>
