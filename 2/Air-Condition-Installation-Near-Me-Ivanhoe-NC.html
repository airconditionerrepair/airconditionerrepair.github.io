<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your home's square footage.

<p>Over the previous few years, there has actually been some promotion suggesting that houseplants have been revealed to decrease levels of some chemicals in lab experiments.
