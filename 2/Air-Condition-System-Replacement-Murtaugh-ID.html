<p>Next, and possibly just as essential when it concerns central air costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not have the ability to correctly cool the house on hot days. Considering larger systems cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>

Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in adequate outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
