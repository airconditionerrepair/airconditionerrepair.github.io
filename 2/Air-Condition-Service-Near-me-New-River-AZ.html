The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
