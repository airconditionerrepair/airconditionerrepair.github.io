<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
