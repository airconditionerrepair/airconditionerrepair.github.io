<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product over time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
