<h3>HVAC Maintenance Plans in Englewood CO</h3>
<p>Geothermal heating is one of the most effective heating sources in terms of ecological costs. Since the energy utilized to heat your home is extracted directly from the ground, it safeguards the environment from damaging digging, fracking, or toxins. Geothermal systems utilize compressor and evaporator systems similar to those used in refrigerators. While geothermal systems do use some electrical energy, they release far fewer greenhouse gases or other toxins than heating systems that require natural gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>If you are considering setting up a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your house, plan on investing several thousand dollars for the complete system. The size of the system determines the labor hours involved to build the system. When you consider installation charges upwards of $50 per hour, to equip a home with the ductwork and vents can cost as much as the brand new furnace or more.<p>
