<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a reference later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters ought to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
