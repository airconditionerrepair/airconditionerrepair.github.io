<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested educating me about our system, and left having fixed the problem with a basic repair he did on-site, not replacing the whole part. He was friendly, straightforward and a thoroughly enjoyable person to have around that entire time. His time and competence to SOLVE the problem cost us less than what we paid the other company simply to do a somewhat unpredictable diagnostic.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
