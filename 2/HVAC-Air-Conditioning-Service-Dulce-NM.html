<p>The quality of the air inside our houses, schools and offices matters, particularly given that we spend the majority of our lives inside your home. A/c unit help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in exceptionally humid environments or in cases where the air conditioner is large, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the a/c will need more energy to cool your home. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>Underfloor heating is easy to install, especially if you make it part of a build or remodelling task. For example, Warmup's StickyMat option can be set up as a Do It Yourself job as it is basic to put down with the electric wire being all pre-spaced and readily connected to the mesh, prepared to be presented in location. Plus, there's even an added cleaning convenience as keeping the spaces dust-free is simpler without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>

High humidities generate mold development and moisture inside your home is connected with a higher occurrence of resident breathing issues.<p>
