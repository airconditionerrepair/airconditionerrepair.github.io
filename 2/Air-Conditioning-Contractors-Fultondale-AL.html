<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
