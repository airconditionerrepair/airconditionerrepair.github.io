<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
