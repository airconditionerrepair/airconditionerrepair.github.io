<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Do not place the condenser under a deck or completely confine it because it exhausts warm air out the top. Any air flow restriction will decrease the unit's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
<p>Compounding the kept in mind health symptoms might be job stress. In part, due to different aspects of workplace automation, the most demanding components of workplace work are increasing.
