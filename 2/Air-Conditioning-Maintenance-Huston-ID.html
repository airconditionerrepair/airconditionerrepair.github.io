<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in each month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use vehicle debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
