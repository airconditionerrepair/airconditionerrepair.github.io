I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He assisted me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again. He is honest, reliable, and sensible on cost. It's difficult to discover an honest AC guy and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely useful in gathering info on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to temporarily handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
