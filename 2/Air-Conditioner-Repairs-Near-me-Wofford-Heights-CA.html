<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise apartment or condos bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has seen the single-family house installation business entirely flip on its head the last few years. Winter season utilized to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not just with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
