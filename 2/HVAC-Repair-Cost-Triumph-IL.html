<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you ought to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.
