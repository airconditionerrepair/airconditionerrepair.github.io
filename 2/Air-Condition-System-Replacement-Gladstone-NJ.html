<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the objective of owning an organisation was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>
