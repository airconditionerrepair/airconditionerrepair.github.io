<p>Correct ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same pollutants. In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>

<p>A/c unit can develop a great deal of water since they remove wetness from the air. To get rid of this, they have a generally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler.
