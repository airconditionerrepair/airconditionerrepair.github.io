A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
