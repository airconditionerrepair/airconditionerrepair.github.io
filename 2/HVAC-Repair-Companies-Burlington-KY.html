While pollutants commonly discovered in indoor air can cause lots of damaging results, there is considerable uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of direct exposure are needed to produce specific health issue. Individuals also react very differently to exposure to indoor air pollutants. More research is needed to much better comprehend which health effects happen after direct exposure to the typical toxin concentrations found in houses and which takes place from the higher concentrations that occur for short amount of times.<p>

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
