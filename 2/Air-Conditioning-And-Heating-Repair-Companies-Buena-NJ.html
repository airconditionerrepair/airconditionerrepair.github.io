<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical material with time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
