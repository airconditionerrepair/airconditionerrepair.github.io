<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
