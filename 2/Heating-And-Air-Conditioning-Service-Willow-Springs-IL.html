<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do.

<p>Unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors.

Common sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, floor, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 48 hours might end up being a source for mold growth and need to be disposed of. In some cases there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can prosper in hidden or seldom accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, chances exist will be mold growing nearby. Repair the moisture problem, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the location using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
