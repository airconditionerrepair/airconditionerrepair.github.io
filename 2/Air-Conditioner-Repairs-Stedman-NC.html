<p>Oil heating systems are usually not very efficient. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but the majority of do not achieve an efficiency higher than 90%.

<p>A 3rd way to choose whether your house may have bad indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, look for indications of issues with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can indicate your house may not have enough ventilation include moisture condensation on walls or windows, foul-smelling or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other items become moldy.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
