<p>The quality of the air inside our houses, work environments and schools matters, particularly because we invest the majority of our lives inside. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in very damp climates or in cases where the air conditioner is oversized, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the a/c will require more energy to cool your home. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>A/c unit producers typically make rugged, high quality products. Begin by inspecting any merges or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the system cool down for about five minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch may have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, located in the compressor's gain access to panel.<p>
