<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
