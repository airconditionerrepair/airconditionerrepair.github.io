<p>You may opt to keep your service and item line simple for now if you're in the very first couple of years of company.

<p>Oftentimes, if materials have stopped working to dry a number of days after the suspected water occasion, mold development is presumed within wall cavities even if it is not immediately noticeable.

<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a difficult job that the workers sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps people working. When a sales man comes to your house he is there to offer, that is the only way he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and must not "need" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I offer you the choices for your needs and you decide if you need it.<p>
