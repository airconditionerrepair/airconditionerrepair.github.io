<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Essential Service in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are ranked 90% efficiency or better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which may be rated as low as 80% efficiency, this can imply substantial savings in annual heating costs. Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase performance even further by performing at lower or greater capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>

<h3>Residential HVAC Contractors in Atglen Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>New air conditioning unit normally vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A higher SEER rating implies greater energy performance and potentially lower energy costs. An excellent SEER ranking for you depends on your house size, where you live and other aspects. Even the minimally permitted SEER score is going to be much more energy effective than your present, old a/c. It's not always about picking the model with the greatest SEER rating, it's finding the one that's right for you. This is where your dealer can help.<p>
<p>If you have a large house, a house with high ceilings, a home with many windows or a home with inadequate insulation, heating your floors instead of the air may not suffice to reach the level of comfort to which you are accustomed.

These modifications might in fact accumulate and potentially minimize your viewed need for in-floor heating.<p>
<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
