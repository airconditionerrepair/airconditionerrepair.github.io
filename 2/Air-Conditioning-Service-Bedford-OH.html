<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more troubles, since a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each room.

In a consisted of system like a house, the warmer items naturally heat the cooler ones till a balance is accomplished.<p>

The minimized air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the issue.<p>
