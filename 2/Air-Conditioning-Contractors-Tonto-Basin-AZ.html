Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
