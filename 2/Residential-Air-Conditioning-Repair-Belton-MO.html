<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets requests for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. However, a lot of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the exact same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring devices will send the sensing unit data to the cloud, where you can access it through software application. You get immediate, real-time access to the tracking results through a dashboard, which turns the data into visual charts that are easy to analyze.<p>

If the symptoms fade or go away when an individual is far from the home and return when the person returns, an effort must be made to determine indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some effects may be made worse by an insufficient supply of outdoor air or from the humidity, heating, or cooling conditions prevalent in the house.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
