<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Leaky return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ issue. Your employer must examine measurements of temperature level, air and humidity circulation. In addition, examination and testing of the ventilation, heating and cooling systems (to make sure it is working according to specifications for constructing use and tenancy) should be carried out. A building walk-through to look for smells and try to find water damage, leaks, dirt or bug droppings might be valuable. Leakages need to be gotten rid of. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c units, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can end up being contaminated with germs or fungi and need to be gotten rid of, likewise.

For example, you can set the thermostat to lower the heat when you're not in home to conserve cash on the energy costs and make sure the system isn't overburdened. An expert technician will inspect the thermostat throughout the annual maintenance to make sure the real temperature level and the temperature level on the thermostat matches. The technician needs to inspect the thermostat's performance or assess the whole HVAC system if there's a difference in the temperature.<p>

This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
