<p>Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals released as gases from items or processes; for the a lot of part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a brand-new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.)
