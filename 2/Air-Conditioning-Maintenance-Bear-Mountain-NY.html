<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue.

<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Bear Mountain NY</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
