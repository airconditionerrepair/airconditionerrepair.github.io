<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>Mobile houses are normally smaller than stick-built residential or commercial properties and use substantially less oil and a much smaller sized furnace to heat.

<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas. Due to the fact that it is impossible to see, smell or taste, CO can kill you before you know it is in your house. At lower levels of exposure, CO causes moderate results that are often mistaken for the influenza. These signs include headaches, lightheadedness, tiredness, queasiness and disorientation. The effects of CO exposure can vary significantly from person to individual depending upon age, general health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
