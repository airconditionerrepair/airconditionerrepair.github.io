<p>IAQ can be impacted by gases (including carbon monoxide, radon, unstable organic compounds ), particulates, microbial contaminants (mold, bacteria ), or any mass or energy stress factor that can cause unfavorable health conditions. Source control, filtration and the use of ventilation to water down pollutants are the primary methods for improving indoor air quality in most buildings.
