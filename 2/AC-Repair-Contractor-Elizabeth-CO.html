<p>Another pollutant of indoor air is outdoor air. At the height of the pollen season or when the air quality index is unhealthy, people with asthma might discover being inside your home offers the very best relief, if the indoor air environment is great.

<p>Geothermal heat pump cost is much more than other heat pump types when installing the whole system. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.

<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered by a Elizabeth CO HVAC Company</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit require fairly little attention. However, as with any mechanical system, some fundamental maintenance is necessary to keep the system working smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit are similar to those of traditional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and storage tank need to be checked for leaks, the system ought to be flushed periodically to remove tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in difficult water areas). The systems should be examined a minimum of two times per year for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be washed regularly to remove dust gathered in order to improve collector efficiency.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
