My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12.

<h3>Electric Heating in Lower Lake CA</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in tons. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>We look at hints prior to we provide recommendations to replace rather than repair a heating unit. One of the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy costs are greater every year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It may be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>
