<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
