While weatherization is underway, however, actions should likewise be taken to lessen contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for advised actions.) In addition, residents must be alert to the introduction of indications of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew growth.

<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices generally lasts decades, since it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical standards get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
