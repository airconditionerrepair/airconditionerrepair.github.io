<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you ought to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
