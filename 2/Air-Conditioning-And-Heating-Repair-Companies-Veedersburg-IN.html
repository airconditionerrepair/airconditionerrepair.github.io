<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your home that best temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those typical air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to pricey repairs down the road. So, be sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service plan which generally includes a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
