Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>Numerous HVAC business owners do not realize they require various prices schemes for different services that their company offers. For example, residential HVAC installation must be priced differently from commercial HVAC installation, and an HVAC service should be priced differently from duct cleaning.
