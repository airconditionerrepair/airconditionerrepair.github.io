There are several style methods in use today; nevertheless, all ground source heatpump operate with similar concepts. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface area units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources also determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>In a split-system central air conditioning conditioner, an outdoor metal cabinet contains the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet contains the evaporator.

PTAC systems might be adapted to offer heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the a/c unit into a heatpump While space cooling offers maximum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
