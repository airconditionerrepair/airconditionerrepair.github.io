<p>The split system is the most common. The majority of people are utilized to seeing this enter the yards of houses. With split system units, the majority of the elements are housed in a metal box outside of the home. However, there are some internal components also. Split systems are ideal for cooling several spaces at once, but are not extremely energy effective. Therefore, one pro is not having loud devices in the home.

<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they give me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
