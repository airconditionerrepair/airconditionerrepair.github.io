<p>The most common kind of home heating system in the U.S. burns natural gas or lp to produce heat. With a typical cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least expensive option, but newer systems can be very energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older gas systems normally attain a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, highly effective natural gas heating systems can attain AFUE ratings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you need to look out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
