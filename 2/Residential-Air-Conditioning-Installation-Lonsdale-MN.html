<p>As many of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices manufacturer's to guarantee your factory guarantees stay in place. In addition, the concrete outcomes of a PM is typically tough to quantify, as one response mentioned the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. The majority of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit don't simply break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the result of repeated usage of a part that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering early wear and tear, causing holes and fractures. , if that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and secures the part.. an extremely useful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
