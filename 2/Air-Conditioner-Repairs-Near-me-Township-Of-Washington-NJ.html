<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
