<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ might observe moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for excellent structure management.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine elements. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, see Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
