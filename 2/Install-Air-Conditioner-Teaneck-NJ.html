Just like other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). COP rates just how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling impact.

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a reference later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
