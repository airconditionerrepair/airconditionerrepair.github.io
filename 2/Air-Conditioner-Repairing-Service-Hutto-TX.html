<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my real estate clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again. He is truthful, trustworthy, and sensible on cost. It's difficult to find a truthful AC man and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical product in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
