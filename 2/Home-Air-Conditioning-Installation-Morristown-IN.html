While toxins commonly found in indoor air can cause many hazardous results, there is considerable unpredictability about what concentrations or periods of exposure are required to produce specific illness.

<p>Reality: Federal and local rewards normally amount to between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can often make the initial rate of a system competitive with conventional devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, during brand-new building (homes normally use in between one and five loads). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap.

Sometimes the treatment is simply removing the individual's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be identified. Soon after exposure to some indoor air toxins, signs of some diseases such as asthma may appear, be aggravated or aggravated.<p>
