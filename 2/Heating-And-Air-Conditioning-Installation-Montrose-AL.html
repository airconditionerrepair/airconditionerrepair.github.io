<p>We take a look at clues before we supply guidance to change instead of repair a heater. One of the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are higher year after year, we understand the unit is not running effectively. It might be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be squandering money by not replacing the older system.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are highly complex and building residents might be exposed to a range of contaminants (in the form of particles and gases) from office makers, cleaning products, building activities, carpets and furnishings, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outdoor pollutants. Other factors such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also impact how people react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
