<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may go into close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and retirement home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
