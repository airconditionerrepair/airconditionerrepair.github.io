<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
