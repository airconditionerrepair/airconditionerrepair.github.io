<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you must check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
