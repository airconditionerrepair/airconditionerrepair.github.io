He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no concerns other than the blower motor.

<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance items that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in expensive compressor failure, however a house owner does not have the abilities or tools required to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and correct air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, however property owners lack the required devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still needed to have an expert technician check the system occasionally.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not produce heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place gradually since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick till you purchase a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, frequently described as central air" or split-system a/c", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the walls, floors, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the a/c unit to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
