<h3>Comparing Commercial Boilers into Residential Boilers in Waterford Works NJ</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by improving air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
