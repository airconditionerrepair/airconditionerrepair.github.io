<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.

However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals.

Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do decline them till they have actually been appropriately dried. Try a various dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
