However, choose your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the same).

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious aspect affecting indoor air quality, however it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have a negative impact on occupants-- outdoors air must be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
