<p>Truth: Federal and local rewards normally amount to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the preliminary cost of a system competitive with traditional equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, throughout brand-new building and construction (houses generally use between one and 5 loads). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. Nevertheless, brand-new installation practices are minimizing costs, to the point where the rate is getting closer to conventional systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
