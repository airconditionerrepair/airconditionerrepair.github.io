<h3>AC Maintenance in Wallsburg Utah</h3>
<p>Reality: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely unusual now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
