<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the exact same. As soon as the circuitry is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively harden and treat-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
