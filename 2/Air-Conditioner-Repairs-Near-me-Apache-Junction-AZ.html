<p>As a number of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment maker's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in place. In addition, the tangible results of a PM is often difficult to quantify, as one response mentioned the savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. The majority of pieces of a furnace or a/c unit don't just break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the result of repetitive use of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing early wear and tear, resulting in fractures and holes. , if that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the component.. an extremely helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
