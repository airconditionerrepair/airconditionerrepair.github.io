Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
