<p>For example, contaminants might gather within the air diffusers and grills, introducing contaminants into the environment. Or if the outside air consumption lies near a source of wetness or other outside toxin, it may act as a path to bring the contaminants inside.

The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step.
