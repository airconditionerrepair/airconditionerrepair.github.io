<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating units are still widely utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a large central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outdoors your house. Heatpump operate on electrical energy and work like air conditioning system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This permits them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heater (like a space heating system) with the very same amount of electrical power. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
