<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you should check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
