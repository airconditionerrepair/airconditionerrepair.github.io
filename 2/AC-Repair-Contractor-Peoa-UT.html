<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have integrated delay functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
