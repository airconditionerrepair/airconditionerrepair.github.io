<h3>Compact Air Conditioner in Brownsville TN</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>

Ilan always makes himself offered - whether it's a heating problem in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more routine calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is competent with these gadgets). I have nothing however excellent things to say - he has actually taken great care of my heating and AC requirements. Quick response - fast resolution.<p>
