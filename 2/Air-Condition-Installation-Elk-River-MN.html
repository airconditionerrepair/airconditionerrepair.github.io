<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
