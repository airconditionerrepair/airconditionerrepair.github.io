<p>There are a great deal of advantages to using a radiant heat system over a standard forced air heater. Radiant heat systems tend to be a lot more energy efficient than other heating systems, for one thing. Required air heating systems tend to struggle with things like duct leakages, which rob them of as much as 30% of their output.

Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
