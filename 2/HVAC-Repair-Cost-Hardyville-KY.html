<p>Typically the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate specific sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to reduce the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is likewise a more cost-efficient method to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are listed later in this section.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service contract attempts to upsell you every time they come to perform routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for 7 years, although it was 6 months prior to the present one expired. She didn't require a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
