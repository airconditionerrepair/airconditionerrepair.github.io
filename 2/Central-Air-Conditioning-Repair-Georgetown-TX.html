<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future.

<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me regarding an unusually high costs that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of issue.

<p>The split system is the most common. The majority of people are used to seeing this type in the backyards of homes. With split system units, the majority of the elements are housed in a metal box beyond the house. Nevertheless, there are some internal parts as well. Split systems are ideal for cooling numerous rooms at the same time, but are not really energy effective. For that reason, one pro is not having loud equipment in the home.
