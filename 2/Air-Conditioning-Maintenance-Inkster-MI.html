<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or lab environments, instead of commercial or outdoor settings. In tasks where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.
