<p>I'll begin with a gas furnace due to the fact that it's the most common heating unit in Seattle houses. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house through ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for performance. Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated procedure. Installing a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
