<p>A main factor in the prevention of health signs is an efficient, correctly developed and running ventilation system. The ventilation system figures out the quality of the indoor air by controlling the quantity of air that is contributed to the workplace environment, the cleanliness of such outside air, and the rate at which the workplace air and its contaminants are either exhausted to the re-circulated or outside throughout the building.<p>
<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as created. Moisture management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the higher temperature levels in some cases used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for the majority of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to supply thermal convenience inside. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities generate mold growth and wetness indoors is connected with a higher occurrence of resident respiratory problems.<p>
