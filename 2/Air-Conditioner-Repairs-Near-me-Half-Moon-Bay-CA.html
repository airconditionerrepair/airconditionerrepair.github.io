It's type of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there have not bothered with it!

<p>The primary reason house owners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the amount of services provided. The cost may not be beneficial if the system is new and still under a producer's guarantee. Any major repairs must be covered under the producer's guarantee.
