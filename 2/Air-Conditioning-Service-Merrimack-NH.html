<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets requests for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Merrimack NH?</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor contaminants and assists exhaust them from the house.<p>

I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event.
