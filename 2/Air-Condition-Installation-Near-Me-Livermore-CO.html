<p>Central air conditioning conditioners are more effective than room ac system. In addition, they are out of the way, quiet, and hassle-free to operate.

In an average air-conditioned home, cooling takes in more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electrical energy annually, triggering power plants to emit about 3,500 pounds of co2 and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>
