<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure.
