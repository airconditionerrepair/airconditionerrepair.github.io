<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Earlysville VA</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even small window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or washed as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will require to have the filters changed regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
