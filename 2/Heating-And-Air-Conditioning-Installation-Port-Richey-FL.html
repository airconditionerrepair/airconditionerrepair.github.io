<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
