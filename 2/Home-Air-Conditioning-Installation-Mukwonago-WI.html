<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
