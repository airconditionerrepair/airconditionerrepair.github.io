<p>The very first air conditioning unit and refrigerators utilized flammable or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might result in fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928.

<h3>What to Look for When Selecting an Idledale CO HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating unit. We chose getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our greatest utility costs. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Invest in education and training: HVAC is not "guideline" work, and no two homes are the same. When specialists are properly trained, they choose and install efficient, safe equipment. They understand what it suggests to provide top-notch craftsmanship, and they get less callbacks from disappointed customers. Creators and supervisors must also remain abreast of progressing technologies and market finest practices.<p>
