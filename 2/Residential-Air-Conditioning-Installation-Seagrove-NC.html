Pushed wood items made for indoor usage consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for decorative wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiber board (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiber board contains a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood product and is typically acknowledged as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood product.<p>

Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Likewise they identified the issue and fixed really quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
