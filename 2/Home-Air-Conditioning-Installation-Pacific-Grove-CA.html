<h3>Hints to Help You Repair Your Furnace in Pacific Grove CA</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present pattern in home construction is to minimize air leakage through fractures and other openings in walls, roofs, and floors. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
