<p>Normally the most efficient way to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate specific sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to decrease the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is likewise a more affordable technique to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later in this section.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
