<p>The people working at Target aren't dumb or lazy and in this company all it takes is one tiny crack in your securities and someone will find it and pry you wide open, often in just a few days. That crack can be an apparently harmless error by a co-worker or perhaps you.

<p>There is no easy response, however many use the general rule that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a better solution.

<p>Ventilation plays a crucial role in indoor air quality.

If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
