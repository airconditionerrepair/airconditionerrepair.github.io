<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Big Lake MN?</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even little window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions require.

Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
