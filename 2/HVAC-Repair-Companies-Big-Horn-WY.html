Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down totally.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price terrific but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
