Just like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling effect.
