These systems can attain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only obtain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Just like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling effect.
