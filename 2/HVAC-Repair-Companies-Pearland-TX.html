On the other hand, ozone is much heavier than air and remains near the floor.<p>

Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you select them up.
