<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>As a lot of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory warranties stay in location. Additionally, the concrete results of a PM is frequently difficult to quantify, as one reaction mentioned the savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. The majority of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit don't just break at the breeze of a finger, however instead is the outcome of repeated use of a part that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering early deterioration, leading to holes and fractures. If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the part.  an extremely helpful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
