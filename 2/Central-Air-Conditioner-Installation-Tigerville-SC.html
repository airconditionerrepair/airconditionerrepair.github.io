<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for assessment and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, much of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>More typical in relatively older homes, a boiler-based heating system uses electricity, oil or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in individual spaces. All-electric boilers can achieve approximately 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers must attain 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers need to achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
