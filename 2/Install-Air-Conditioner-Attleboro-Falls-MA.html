Load determining is referred to as the Manual J computation and must be carried out by the HVAC contractor before providing an installation or system cost for a/c.

Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no concerns aside from the blower motor.
