<p>While individuals invest 90% of their time inside, indoor air quality has actually not been a big focus of attention for centers management and renters up until just recently. The coronavirus break out is bringing indoor air quality into the spotlight as medical facilities work to mitigate the spread of disease and offices, retail, and education facilities are considering methods to reopen safely and decrease infection.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it might grovel twice the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use. That's because it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to offer a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment set up just a couple of years earlier.<p>
