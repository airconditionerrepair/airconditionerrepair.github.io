Simply put, in some cases the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas.

<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company used 98% of the existing product acquired with your house. This company introduced a service arrangement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the inspection on a really cold day they killed the furnace claiming health danger factor and contractor laws for their choice. As a new homeowner I have discovered how to determine the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
