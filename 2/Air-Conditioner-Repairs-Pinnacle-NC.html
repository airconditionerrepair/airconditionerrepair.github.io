<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the very same. When the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up.
