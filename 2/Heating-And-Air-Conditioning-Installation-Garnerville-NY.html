<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. Once the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively cure and solidify-- usually 2 to 4 weeks.
