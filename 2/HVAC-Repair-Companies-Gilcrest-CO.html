The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

Many typically they are installed at height-level or somewhat lower, if people mainly stay seated in that particular area. However, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate towards the flooring or ceiling; depending on what contaminant you're attempting to track you'll need to position the sensing unit appropriately.
