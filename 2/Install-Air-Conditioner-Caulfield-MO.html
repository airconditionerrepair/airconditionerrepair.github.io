<h3>Truth All Homeowners Should Know About HVAC Installation in Caulfield MO</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
