<h3>Installation of HVAC in Liberty Corner NJ</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
