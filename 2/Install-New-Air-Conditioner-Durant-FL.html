<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't release heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen over time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to work up until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
