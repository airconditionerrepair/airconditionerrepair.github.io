<p>Place the solar tank near the standard water heater.

<h3>Central Heating System in Huntington Indiana</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech showed up right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the check out. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the new part. I was very delighted they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will absolutely be utilizing them once again.<p>
<p>Energy performance can be enhanced much more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating systems.

In this case, the control system is extremely vital to preserving a proper temperature level.<p>
<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
