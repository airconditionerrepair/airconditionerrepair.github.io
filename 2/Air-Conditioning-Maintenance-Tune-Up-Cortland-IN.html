<h3>Selecting Commercial HVAC Repair Services in Cortland IN</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heater require fairly little attention. However, similar to any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is necessary to keep the system working efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system resemble those of conventional water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank should be checked for leakages, the system needs to be flushed regularly to get rid of tank and collected pollutants (scaling in hard water locations). The systems need to be examined a minimum of twice annually for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to eliminate dust collected in order to improve collector efficiency.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.
