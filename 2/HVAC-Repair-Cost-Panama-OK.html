<p>Bear in mind that the SEER ranking is determined using the exact same set of temperatures across the board. The average summer temperature to arrive at the SEER score is 83 degrees, so to come to the correct SEER score for your location, deduct 2 points for every 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER rating has to be at least 13 for all brand-new a/c units made in the United States.<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
