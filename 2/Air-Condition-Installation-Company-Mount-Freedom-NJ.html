<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue.

<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure applied to buy additional stuff. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew just what the issue was and repaired it very rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
