<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.

Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of.
