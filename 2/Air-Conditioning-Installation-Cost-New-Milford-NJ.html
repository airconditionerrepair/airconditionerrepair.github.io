<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up frequently, they can end up being clogged with debris that can restrict airflow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Filthy filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases cause the system to close down totally. By contrast, replacing a furnace and checking filter can usually be done in just a couple of minutes, often without any tools required. As a precaution, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
