<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the standard water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be turned off completely.<p>

<p>When our furnace was dying, we contacted 2 local companies for quotes. While both were practical and helpful, Ballard Natural Gas offered us a much better deal, for remarkable service. Rather than a basic sales job, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heater and located ways we could have more even heat. He consisted of these substantial but small modifications in his quote. Due to the fact that of current warmer summertimes and for environmental reasons, we decided to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
