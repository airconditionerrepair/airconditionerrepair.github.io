<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to provide adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A common aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
