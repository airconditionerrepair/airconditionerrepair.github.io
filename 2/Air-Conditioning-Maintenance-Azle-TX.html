<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to correctly service and the system has been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<h3>AC Service in Azle TX</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

The two operations use different procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to accomplish its goals.<p>
