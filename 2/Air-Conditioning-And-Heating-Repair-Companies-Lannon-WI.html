<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
