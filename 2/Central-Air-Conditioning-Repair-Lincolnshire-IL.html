<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a difficult task that the workers sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps men working. When a sales man pertains to your house he exists to sell, that is the only way he is paid.
