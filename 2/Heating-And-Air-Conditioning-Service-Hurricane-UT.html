<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
