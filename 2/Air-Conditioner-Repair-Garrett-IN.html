<p>I am very amazed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years earlier and understand the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for residence residents. Unlike other kinds of air conditioning system, evaporative coolers rely on the outdoors air to be transported through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the within a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air must be enabled to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to comprehend and maintain.<p>
