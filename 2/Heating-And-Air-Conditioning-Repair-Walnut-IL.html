Though specific regulations have not been developed for IAQ in the work place, the Environment, Health and Safety Department (EHS) considers suggestions from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and A/c Engineers (ASHRAE).<p>

<p>I typically do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
