<p>A third way to choose whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, try to find signs of issues with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can indicate your home might not have enough ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or foul-smelling air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products become moldy. To detect smells in your house, action outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether smells are noticeable.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
