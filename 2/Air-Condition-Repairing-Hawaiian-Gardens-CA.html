<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
