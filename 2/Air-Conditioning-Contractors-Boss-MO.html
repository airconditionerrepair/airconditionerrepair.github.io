<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Boss MO</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his inspection, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
