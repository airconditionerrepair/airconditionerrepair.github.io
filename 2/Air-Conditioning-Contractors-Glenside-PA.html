<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most inexpensive if your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated by radiators are prone to cold spots", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot next to the radiators.
