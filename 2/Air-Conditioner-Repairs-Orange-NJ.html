He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business several years earlier and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running.

<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by individuals and animals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. It can end up being airborne when it dries.
