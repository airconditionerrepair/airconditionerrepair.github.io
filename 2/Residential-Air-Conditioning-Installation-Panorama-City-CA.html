<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Panorama City CA</h3>
<p>When you and your household walk into your home in Sacramento, CA, are you as comfortable as you can be? Do you discover it to be either too cold throughout the winter or too warm in locations during the summer season? Whether you're having a problem with uneven cooling or heating, or your indoor air quality isn't up to par, Sierra Pacific Home & Convenience, Inc. has the product or services you need.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
