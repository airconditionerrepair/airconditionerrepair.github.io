<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it could flatter twice the electricity that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's since it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to offer a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER.

<p>Most HVAC systems now have programmable thermostats that enable homeowner to control the temperature and set it on a schedule. For instance, you can set the thermostat to lower the heat when you're not in home to save cash on the energy expenses and ensure the system isn't overburdened. A professional technician will inspect the thermostat during the yearly maintenance to ensure the actual temperature level and the temperature level on the thermostat matches.

<h3>Benefits of Investing on Gas Furnaces at Rex GA</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
<p>There are lots of factors to think about when picking a brand-new furnace. Trust our skilled technicians to set out all your alternatives. We'll visit your home for a comprehensive inspection, consisting of an analysis of your existing ductwork and floorplan to discover the very best system for your house. Buying a furnace that's either too huge or too small for your house will trigger issues down the roadway, so we'll make sure your furnace installation is just right, providing warmth, high efficiency, balanced humidity, and years of dependability. Must you desire or require a repair to set up regular furnace maintenance, we're the group for that, too.<p>
