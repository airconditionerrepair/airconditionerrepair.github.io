<p>Cooling can also be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>Normally the most effective way to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to reduce the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more affordable approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later on in this section.<p>
<p>Depending upon where in the US your house lies, the local region's environment can alter dramatically. A home situated in the South would need an AC system with a size capable of cooling your home due to heat Summers. A home in the Northern part of the United States would require a much bigger heating capability also which will affect expenses. See the chart listed below for the typical central air conditioner replacement expenses by LOTS.<p>
