One of the main areas where clogs begin to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a reference later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4).

The female crimp connectors ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
