<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues in homes. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the home. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or so.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
