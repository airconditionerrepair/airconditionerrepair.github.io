<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my services, my own homes and my property customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. When I called and he advised me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he helped me difficulty shoot the concern. He is honest, dependable, and reasonable on rate. It's hard to discover a sincere AC person and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>A packaged unit, typically installed on the roofing system, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also a choice for house owners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems include not just the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system independently, since the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are usually just available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be a great way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best alternative for house owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
