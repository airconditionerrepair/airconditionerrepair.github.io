<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the same toxins. To put it simply, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>Fact: Federal and local incentives typically amount to in between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the initial cost of a system competitive with standard equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capacity, during brand-new building (homes normally utilize between one and five lots). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. Nevertheless, brand-new installation practices are decreasing expenses, to the point where the price is getting closer to standard systems under the right conditions.<p>
