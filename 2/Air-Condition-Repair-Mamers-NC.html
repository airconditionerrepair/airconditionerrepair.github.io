<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everybody can manage, numerous Seattleites must discover methods to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in big box stores like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC systems are snatched up as soon as they're stacked in flooring display screens. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a terrible, vicious summertime.<p>
