<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
