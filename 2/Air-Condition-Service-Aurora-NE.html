You guys are formally on speed dial. Talk to you quickly.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most heaters have several control boards. The biggest, or just one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the new control board must be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t correctly diagnosed, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
