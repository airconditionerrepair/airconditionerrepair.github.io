<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you should inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
