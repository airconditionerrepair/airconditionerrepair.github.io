The female crimp ports ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight.

The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most budget friendly. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct work runs between $300 to $500 on average. It's the ductwork that delivers cold air to each space in your house, and if it establishes fractures which leak, they need to be fixed. Having malfunctioning ductwork makes your system work harder with even worse results. Your home will not be sufficiently cooled, and your energy expenses will increase. Setting up brand-new ductwork for the whole home will cost approximately between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
