<h3>The Way to Maintain Healthy Ductwork To Get A Healthy Home in Verona KY</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely pleased that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to return and fix the air conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance plan, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioner prior to you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to evaluate AC units even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
