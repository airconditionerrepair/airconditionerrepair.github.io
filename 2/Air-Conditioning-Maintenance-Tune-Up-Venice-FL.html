<p>We added a new 1500 sf office space to perform our workshops and required some heating. After calling Integrity we were given a great quote on a radiant floor system. We were in a time crunch for upcoming occasion, and Tyler came right out and had us hooked up in a couple of days. The systems works terrific and the brand-new office feels very comfortable. It was a pleasure working with such an expert company and would highly suggest them to anyone searching for HVAC.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO protect the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor carefully, many of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service agreement attempts to upsell you every time they pertain to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, even though it was six months before the present one ended. She didn't need a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
