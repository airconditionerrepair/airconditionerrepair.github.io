We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the same toxins. In other words, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>

Children may have higher direct exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
