<h3>Heat Ventilation in Elma NY</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
