Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>

He made a few recommendations of some maintenance tasks we might wish to have actually done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics employed by some in the industry.<p>
