<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
