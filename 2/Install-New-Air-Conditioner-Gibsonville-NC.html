<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the main problem. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more problems, given that some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each room.

<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but your home does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
