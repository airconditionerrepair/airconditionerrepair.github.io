<p>Indoor air contamination originates from a variety of sources; the US Epa (EPA) has identified structure products, furnishings, and mold as major concerns, but much of the threat also originates from burning things.

This is a particularly huge issue in the developing world.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle.
