<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals produced as gases from products or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
