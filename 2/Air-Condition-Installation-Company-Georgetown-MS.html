<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
