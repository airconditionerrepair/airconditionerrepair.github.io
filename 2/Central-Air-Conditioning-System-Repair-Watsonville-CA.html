<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely pleased that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to return and fix the air conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioner prior to you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to evaluate AC units even in winter season. We wish we had known him then.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You must hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
