<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
