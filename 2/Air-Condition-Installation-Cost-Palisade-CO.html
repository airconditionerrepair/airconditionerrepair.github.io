<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very handy in collecting information on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to momentarily handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and provided clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely utilize Stability Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to provide enough modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical component required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
