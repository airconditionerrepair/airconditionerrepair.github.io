<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either since of noticeable development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
