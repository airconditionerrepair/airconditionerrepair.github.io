<p>Co2 (CO2) is a fairly easy to determine surrogate for indoor contaminants emitted by human beings, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high indoors might cause residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in most buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Open windows or use exhaust fans.

As a result, the most reliable method to lower direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the home is to eliminate smoking there.<p>
