<h3>HVAC Repairman Near Me in Alton Missouri</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>
