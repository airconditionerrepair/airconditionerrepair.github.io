<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  system instead of ducting air straight from the outside system. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
