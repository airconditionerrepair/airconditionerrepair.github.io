He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
