<p>Indoor air quality (likewise called "indoor ecological quality") explains how within air can impact a person's health, ability, and comfort to work. It can consist of temperature, humidity, absence of outside air (bad ventilation), mold from water damage, or exposure to other chemicals. Presently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) requirements but it does provide guidelines about the most typical IAQ office complaints.<p>
<p>Regularly, however, detectives will need to come to the building to perform personal interviews with occupants, to try to find possible sources of the problems, and to inspect the design and operation of the ventilation system and other structure features. Since taking measurements of pollutants at the extremely low levels typically found in office buildings is expensive and might not yield information readily beneficial in recognizing issue sources, private investigators may not take many measurements. The procedure of fixing indoor air quality problems that lead to health and comfort complaints can be a sluggish one, involving several trial solutions before successful remedial actions are determined.<p>
