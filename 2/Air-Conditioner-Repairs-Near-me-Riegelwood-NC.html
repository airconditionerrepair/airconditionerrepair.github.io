<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical product with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
