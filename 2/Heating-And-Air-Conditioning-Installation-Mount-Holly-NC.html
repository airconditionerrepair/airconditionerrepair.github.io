We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the very same toxins.

<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned frequently, they can end up being obstructed with debris that can limit air flow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's efficiency.

By comparison, checking and changing a furnace filter can generally be carried out in simply a couple of minutes, frequently without any tools needed. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
