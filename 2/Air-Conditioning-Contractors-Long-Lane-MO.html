<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Vital Company in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% performance or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern-day furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which may be rated as low as 80% effectiveness, this can mean significant cost savings in yearly heating costs. Modern 2- and three-stage furnaces increase performance even further by performing at lower or greater capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>

Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
