<p>Sean was very valuable. He is an extremely enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no issues besides the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
