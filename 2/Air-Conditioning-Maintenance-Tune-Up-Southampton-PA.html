<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Southampton PA?</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Lots of elements affect IAQ. These aspects include bad ventilation (lack of outside air), issues managing temperature, high or low humidity, recent improvement, and other activities in or near a structure that can impact the fresh air entering into the building. Sometimes, specific pollutants like dust from construction or restoration, mold, cleaning supplies, pesticides, or other airborne chemicals (including small amounts of chemicals released as a gas in time) might trigger bad IAQ.<p>
