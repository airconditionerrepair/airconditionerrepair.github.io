<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
