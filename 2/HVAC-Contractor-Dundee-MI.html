<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
