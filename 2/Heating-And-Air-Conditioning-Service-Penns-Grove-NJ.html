<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to ten years old, it might grovel two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would use.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
