<p>In an area where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great primary heating systems. You'll want to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperature levels reach freezing.

<p>You might upgrade to the greatest efficiency gear available and still not feel conveniently cool on hot days. That's because the mechanicals are only part of the central air system. The average home's ductwork leakages 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your living space, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Prior to deciding whether to repair or change your condenser and blower systems, your technician must run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining how much air escapes the system.<p>
