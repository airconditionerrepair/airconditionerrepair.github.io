You can often conclude that the capacitor has stopped working. Often you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille.

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
