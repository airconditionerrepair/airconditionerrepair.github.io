<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one constraint: their total power should not surpass the capacity of the outside unit.

It might be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be losing cash by not changing the older system.<p>
