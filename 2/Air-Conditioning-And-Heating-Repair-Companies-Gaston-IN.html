Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>We look at ideas prior to we offer recommendations to change rather than repair a heating system. Among the ideas we look at is the cost of energy.
