<p>Certain immediate results are similar to those from colds or other viral illness, so it is often tough to figure out if the symptoms are an outcome of exposure to indoor air contamination. For this factor, it is important to pay attention to the time and place the signs occur. If the symptoms fade or disappear when an individual is far from the home and return when the individual returns, an effort should be made to recognize indoor air sources that might be possible causes.

<p>Whatever heater you set up, it's vital that it's sized properly for your home. Too big and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should. Plus, it will use too much energy for the amount of heat you want produced.

Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star advises replacing your filter. Throughout high usage months, check the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
