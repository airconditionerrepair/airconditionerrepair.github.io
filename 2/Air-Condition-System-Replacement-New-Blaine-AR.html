<p>Considering that the 1980s, producers of HVAC equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they make more effective. This was initially driven by increasing energy costs, and has actually more recently been driven by increased awareness of ecological issues. Additionally, improvements to the HVAC system performance can also help increase occupant health and productivity. 21 In the United States, the EPA has imposed tighter constraints over the years. There are a number of techniques for making HVAC systems more effective.<p>
<p>Some biological contaminants trigger allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma. Contagious illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Mildews and molds launch disease-causing toxins. Signs of illness caused by biological toxins consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, lethargy, fever, and digestion problems.<p>
<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical product gradually. In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
