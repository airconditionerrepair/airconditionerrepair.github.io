If you already have a home heating system, you may search for a heatpump more geared towards cooling capacity and efficiency. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to search for a design that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. The bright side is that the one major disadvantage of heatpump is that they can fail in the exceptionally hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
