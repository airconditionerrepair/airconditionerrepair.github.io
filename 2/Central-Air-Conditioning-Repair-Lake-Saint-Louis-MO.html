<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as merely radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating components set up in the subfloor of each room in the house, periodically connected to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
