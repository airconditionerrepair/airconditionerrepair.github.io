<h3>Advantages Of Hiring AC Repair Services at East Freetown MA</h3>
<p>Medical facility operating theatres, in which air is filtered to high levels to decrease infection threat and the humidity managed to limit patient dehydration. Although temperature levels are frequently in the comfort variety, some expert procedures, such as open heart surgery, need low temperature levels (about 18 ° C, 64 ° F) and others, such as neonatal, fairly heats (about 28 ° C, 82 ° F).

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
