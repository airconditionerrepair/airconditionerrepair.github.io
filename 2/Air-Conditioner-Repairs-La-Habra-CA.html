<h3>How Do Air Heat Pump Works in La Habra CA?</h3>
<p>Many people know that outdoor air pollution can affect their health, however indoor air contamination can also have considerable, hazardous impact. EPA studies of human direct exposure to air pollutants indicate that indoor levels of pollutants might be 2 to five times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- greater than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air pollution among the top 5 environmental health risks to the public.<p>
<p>Since an air conditioning system moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both need to be kept tidy. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
