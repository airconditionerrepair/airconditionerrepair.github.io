<p>Make sure there are no carpets, furniture, or anything else limiting the circulation of air. Not just will blocked vents and registers affect your comfort, they can also cause duct leakages due to extreme air pressure and premature HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and registers in unused rooms is NOT a good idea. You will not conserve any extra money and will wind up triggering more issues for your heating unit.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with inadequately changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Normally the most effective way to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate specific sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to decrease the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-effective technique to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later in this area.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the 2 should not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC use the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's supply of water, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for producing power in the kind of electrical power. The 2 operations utilize various processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be warmed to boiling point to achieve its goals.<p>
