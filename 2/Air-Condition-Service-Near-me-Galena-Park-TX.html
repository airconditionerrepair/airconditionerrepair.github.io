<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were incredibly popular in the first half of the 20th century, particularly in commercial structures, apartment and very large residences. Many steam and radiator boiler systems set up more than 50 years ago stay operable, because the lack of moving parts makes them less prone to tear and use. A steam boiler replacement costs in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>

<p>Similar to the majority of home improvement jobs, the cost of a complete central heating system can vary widely based on the size of the home. Many heating systems will last between 15 and twenty years. In picking a furnace, property owners should consider heat output and effectiveness. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace need to be matched to the size of the house. A little house, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too quickly and shut off for too long, resulting in irregular temperature levels.<p>
