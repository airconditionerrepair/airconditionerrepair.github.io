<p>At present, EPA does not recommend using air cleaners to lower levels of radon and its decay items. The efficiency of these gadgets doubts because they just partly remove the radon decay products and do not reduce the quantity of radon entering the house. EPA plans to do extra research on whether air cleaners are, or could become, a reliable means of reducing the health threat from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, offers more details on air-cleaning devices to reduce indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Prior to you go out and purchase an air conditioning system, there are a few things to choose initially. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioning system? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How big should the ac system be?

These are simply a few of the elements that you need to consider when buying a brand-new AC system.
