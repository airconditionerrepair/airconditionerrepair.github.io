<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Pe Ell WA</h3>
<p>I have been using Waychoff for about 10 years. Initially, they repaired a bad installation from a previous company. Thereafter, they have actually preserved my system semi-annually. Their techs are very well-informed and professional. Expenses are reasonable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their way.

<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run. An oversize compressor also costs more to run because it simply takes more electrical power to run a larger unit. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The result is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature shows. In truth, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>
