<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was kind of strange being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The product was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to use. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets.

<p>Use professionals and treat them well: Encouraged, well-compensated professionals perform much better work than short-term subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success. An ethical company does not exploit cheap labor opportunities just because they're low-cost. Affordable workmanship is normally shoddy craftsmanship, and it never ever helps a company develop long-term relationships with customers.<p>
<p>The split system is the most typical. Many people are utilized to seeing this enter the backyards of homes. With split system units, the majority of the parts are housed in a metal box outside of the home. Nevertheless, there are some internal elements too. Split systems are ideal for cooling several rooms at once, but are not really energy efficient. For that reason, one pro is not having loud equipment in the home. At the very same time, the con would be that those who utilize this may spend more cash on cooling expenses in the long run because of the lower energy performance.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to provide enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A common component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
