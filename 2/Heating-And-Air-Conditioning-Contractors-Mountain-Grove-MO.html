<p>While contaminant levels from individual sources may not posture a considerable health risk by themselves, many houses have more than one source that contributes to indoor air pollution. There can be a major threat from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Fortunately, there are actions that the majority of people can take both to decrease the danger from existing sources and to avoid brand-new issues from taking place. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Item Safety Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to act that can decrease the level of indoor air pollution in your own home.<p>
<p>Most well and city water does not normally include lead. Water normally picks up lead inside the home from household plumbing that is made with lead materials. The only method to know if there is lead in drinking water is to have it checked. Contact the local health department or the water provider to find out how to get the water tested. Send out for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more details about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to learn more.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit toxins.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Sometimes a short-lived indoor air quality problem is produced simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a room or building, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's required, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more complicated concerns-- recognized by consistently unacceptable air quality monitoring results-- will need a various tack. Depending upon the issue you're experiencing, one of the 3 strategies below might be appropriate.<p>
