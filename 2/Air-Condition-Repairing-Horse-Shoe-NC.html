<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not only was the cost great but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>I am very pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years back and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
