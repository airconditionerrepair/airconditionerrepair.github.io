<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices generally lasts years, considering that it is safeguarded inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical standards remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot with time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
