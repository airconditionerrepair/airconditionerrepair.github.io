<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ may notice undesirable or musty smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are getting worse, talk to your medical professional about them. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>
