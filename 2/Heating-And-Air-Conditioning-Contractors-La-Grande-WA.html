<h3>Getting Through Central Heating Installation in La Grande WA</h3>
<p>Numerous Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that deals with indoor air quality issues. In the lack of such legislation, the "basic duty clause" applies. This provision, common to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, mentions that an employer should offer a safe and healthy  office. Thus, making certain the air is of great quality is the company's responsibility.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
