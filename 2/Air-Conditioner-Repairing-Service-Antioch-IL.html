<h3>AC Maintenance in Antioch Illinois</h3>
<p>If your air conditioning unit is more than 8 years of ages, repair is most likely not worth the expense, unless it's a simple issue like particles obstructing the condenser unit or a used fan belt. Still, to finest weigh your repair-or-replace choice, ask your contractor to evaluate not simply the condition of your existing equipment, however likewise the ducts that deliver the cool air and the total quality of the insulation in your home. Improving those components might increase the efficiency of the system as much or more than installing brand-new equipment.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>If your a/c unit is old, think about purchasing an energy-efficient design. Look for the ENERGY STAR Â® and EnergyGuide labels - qualified central systems are about 15% more effective than basic models. New residential central air conditioner requirements entered into effect on January 1, 2015; see the efficiency requirements for central air conditioning conditioners for information, and consider buying a system with a greater SEER than the minimum for higher savings.<p>
