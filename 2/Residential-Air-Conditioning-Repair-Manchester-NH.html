<p>I have actually been utilizing them for years for my services, my own homes and my property customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again, he helped me difficulty shoot the problem. He is honest, reliable, and affordable on rate. It's tough to find an honest AC guy and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Extremely suggest Luis and his company.<p>

If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for seven years, despite the fact that it was 6 months before the existing one expired. She didn't need a air filtration system, however they talked her into it.<p>
