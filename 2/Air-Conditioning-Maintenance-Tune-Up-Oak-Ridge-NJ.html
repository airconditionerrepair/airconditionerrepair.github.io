<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>House owners might also assume that since a glowing flooring heating system can be seen (and financed) as a home enhancement, its installation will immediately raise their house's worth.

<p>Some sources, such as building products, home furnishings, and household items like air fresheners, release toxins more or less continually.

These include cigarette smoking, making use of malfunction-ing or unvented ranges, furnaces, or space heating units, the use of solvents in cleaning and hobby activities, the use of paint strippers in refurnishing activities, and the use of cleaning products and pesticides in house cleaning. High toxin concentrations can stay in the air for long periods after a few of these activities.<p>
