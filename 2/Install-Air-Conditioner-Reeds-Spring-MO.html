<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run because it needs to run longer than a correctly sized system. Since it merely takes more electrical power to run a larger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The outcome is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
