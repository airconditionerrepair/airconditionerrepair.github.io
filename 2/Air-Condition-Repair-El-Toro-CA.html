<p>Because it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for performance. Older units from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, implying 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your house already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a fairly uncomplicated procedure. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather costly.<p>

Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
