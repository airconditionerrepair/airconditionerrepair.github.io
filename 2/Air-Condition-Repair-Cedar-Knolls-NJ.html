<h3>Central Air Conditioning Companies in Cedar Knolls NJ</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
