<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
