<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
