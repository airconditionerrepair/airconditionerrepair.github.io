<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that may impact the health of individuals who reside in the house. Contaminants could originate from outside the house-- such as an idling vehicle engine in a connected garage, yard trash burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground below. An air contaminant might also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, volatile organic substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or personal care products. Germs and infections, animal dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit pollutants.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
