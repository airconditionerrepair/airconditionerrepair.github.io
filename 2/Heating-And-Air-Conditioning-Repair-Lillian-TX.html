<p>Lead has actually long been acknowledged as a hazardous environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " top ecological risk to the health of children in the United States." There are numerous ways in which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead gets in the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Before it was known how harmful lead might be, it was used in paint, gas, water pipes, and numerous other products.<p>
<p>Regularly, indoor air quality issues in large commercial buildings can not be effectively recognized or remedied without a comprehensive structure examination.
