<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me regarding an unusually high expense that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he understood that I had called the service manager and left a message of concern. Ron had actually found the trouble area in looking over the bill. He fixed the problem in one day, had adjusted the costs to what I considered fair before he recalled, understood what might have caused the problem and had a plan to guarantee that it would not happen again. I have thought about All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have used them. This experience validates that.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everybody can afford, many Seattleites need to discover ways to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in big box shops like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in floor displays. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a terrible, cruel summer season.<p>
