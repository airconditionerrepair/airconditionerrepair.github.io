If you've checked the air in your home and found a radon issue, and you have a well, contact a laboratory accredited to measure radiation in water to have your water checked. Radon problems in water can be readily fixed. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to find out more.<p>
<p>The toxins noted in this guide have been shown to cause the health results pointed out. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily true that the results kept in mind occur at the pollutant concentration levels typically found in the home. In many cases, our understanding of the toxins and their health impacts is too minimal to figure out the levels at which the listed effects could take place.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a distribution system. Metal pipelines are rarely used due to long-lasting destructive concerns. Virtually all hydronic radiant floor heat systems today utilize 1/2 inch diameter plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is extremely versatile, will not rust and can be found in long lengths, which permit PEX pipeline to be woven with minimal or no joints.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by people and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
