Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, talk to your doctor about them.

Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you discover you have to do it frequently, it's probably time for a professional opinion.<p>
