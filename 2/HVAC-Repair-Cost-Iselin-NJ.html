<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same. Once the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately treat and harden-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>

The radiators might be installed on walls or installed within the flooring to produce flooring heat.<p>
