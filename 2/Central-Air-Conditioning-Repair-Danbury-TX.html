A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine parts. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, check out Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
