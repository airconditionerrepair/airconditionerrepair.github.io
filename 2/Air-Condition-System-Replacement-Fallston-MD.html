<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller house, which will impact installation expenses. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other elements that can affect this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
