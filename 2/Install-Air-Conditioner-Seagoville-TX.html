Although he didn't have the needed replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could try to find and buy it the next morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely grateful to have a heated house once again. What's most incredible was that this all happened throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to help us right before a vacation, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily recommend this company to my pals.<p>
<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be serious. They include hold-ups in physical and psychological advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Infants, fetuses, and kids are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults since lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the damaging results of lead.
