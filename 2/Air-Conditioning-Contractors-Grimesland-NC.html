Stale air has greater levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. Stagnant air may likewise be a problem when ventilation is not sufficient to represent a boost in the number of employees in the area.<p>
<p>There is a necessary balance in making your choice though as systems with higher AFUE ratings frequently come with higher price tags. So, ensure to decide based on how often you will utilize your heating unit, the load that will be put on it and the frequency with which you plan on having it serviced each year. For many temperate climates with low heating loads in the winter season, having an incredibly high rated heating system is not always essential.<p>
