<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a recommendation in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor.
