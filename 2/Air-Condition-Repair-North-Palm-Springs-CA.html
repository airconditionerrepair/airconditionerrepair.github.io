<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, occasionally linked to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
