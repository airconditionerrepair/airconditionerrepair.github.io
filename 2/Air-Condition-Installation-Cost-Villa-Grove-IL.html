<h3>Replacing Your Boiler in Villa Grove IL</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
