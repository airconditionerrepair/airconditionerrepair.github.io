<p>Oil heating systems are generally not really effective. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, but most do not achieve a performance higher than 90%.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must look out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
