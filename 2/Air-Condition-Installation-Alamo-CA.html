This is usually utilized in a second or third-floor  location and makes the most of the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber radiant flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipelines to direct heat upward.<p>
