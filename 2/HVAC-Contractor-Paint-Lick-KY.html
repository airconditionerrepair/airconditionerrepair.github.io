<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
