<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. When the electrical wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly treat and harden-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
