<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most economical if your home or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct work runs in between $300 to $500 typically. It's the ductwork that provides cold air to each space in your home, and if it develops cracks which leak, they need to be repaired. Having malfunctioning ductwork makes your system work harder with even worse results. Your home will not be properly cooled, and your energy costs will increase. Installing brand-new ductwork for the whole house will cost an average of in between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>

Before inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts.
