<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
