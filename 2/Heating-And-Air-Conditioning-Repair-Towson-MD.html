Rather than an easy sales job, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heating system and situated ways we could have more even heat.

Because of current warmer summertimes and for environmental reasons, we chose to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning system works however the house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
