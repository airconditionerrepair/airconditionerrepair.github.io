<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
