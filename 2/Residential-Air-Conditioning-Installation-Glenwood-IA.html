The choice of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power should not surpass the capability of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems higher than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the very same time, considering that the overall capacity of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outside system. Basically, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms might not have a really comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not easy, given that it considers not only the nominal power of the units, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
