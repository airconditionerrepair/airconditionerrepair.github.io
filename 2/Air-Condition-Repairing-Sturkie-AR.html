Unscrew the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Photo 6).<p>

<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material in time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
