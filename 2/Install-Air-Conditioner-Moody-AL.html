<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the task and also the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
