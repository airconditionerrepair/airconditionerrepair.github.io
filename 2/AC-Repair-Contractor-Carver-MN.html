<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating systems are still commonly utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
