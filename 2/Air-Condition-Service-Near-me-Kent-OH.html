<p>Volatile natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals released as gases from items or processes; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might include unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, humans breathe out carbon dioxide, which in little amounts is not toxic, but may end up being dangerous if high concentrations are allowed to collect. Bacteria or micro-organisms might likewise be present within the ventilation system. They might spread throughout the entire office or structure by ways of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
