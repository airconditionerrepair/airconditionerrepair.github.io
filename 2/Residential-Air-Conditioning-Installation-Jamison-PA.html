<h3>Heating System Installation in Jamison PA</h3>
<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
