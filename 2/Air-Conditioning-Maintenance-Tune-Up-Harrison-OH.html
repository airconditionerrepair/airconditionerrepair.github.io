<p>A Lot Of Midtown Houston Tx clients don't understand why their HVAC unit is not working when they position a 24 hr emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you remain in luck, that's probably your problem.
