<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, considering that it is secured inside. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat gradually, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that perfect temperature level all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those common air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their task.

So, be sure to change your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service strategy which generally includes a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
