<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for assessment and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, a lot of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
