<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their overall power should not exceed the capacity of the outside system. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units higher than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, because the total capability of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor system. Basically, the outside system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that some of the spaces may not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the estimation of the overall power is not simple, since it considers not just the nominal power of the systems, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
