<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely valuable in gathering info on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to briefly cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and used clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and home.<p>
