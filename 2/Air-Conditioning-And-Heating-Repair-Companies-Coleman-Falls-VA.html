<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you must check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
