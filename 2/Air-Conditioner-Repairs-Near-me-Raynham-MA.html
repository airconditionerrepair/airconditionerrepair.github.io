<p>HVAC coils normally give you a good 15-20 years of life before they start developing refrigerant leakages. Refrigerant leakages aren't the only issue air conditioning coils have.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like prolonged automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to effectively service and the system has actually been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
