If you didn't create a cooling and heating company strategy when you started your business, it's not far too late to develop one now, or to give your initial strategy an upgrade.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
