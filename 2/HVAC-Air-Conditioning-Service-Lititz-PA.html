<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Radiant heating uses a variety of special benefits over forced air heating systems. For instance, radiant heating systems are more energy effective than forced air systems.

Sending heat through solid things will likewise cause it to last longer than utilizing air as a thermal medium.
