Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
