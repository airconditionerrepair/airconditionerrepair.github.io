<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

R-600 (isobutane) is currently extensively used in residential refrigeration.<p>

<p>Generally the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-effective approach to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are listed later on in this area.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
