<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a reference in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
