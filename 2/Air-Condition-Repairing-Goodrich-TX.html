<p>Information provided in this safety guide is based on existing scientific and technical understanding of the concerns provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies. Structures constantly evolve as an outcome of the changes in the environment around them in addition to the residents, materials, and activities within them. The numerous surfaces and the air inside a building are continuously interacting, and this interaction results in changes in each. For example, we might see a window as altering a little in time as it ends up being unclean, then is cleaned, builds up dirt once again, is cleaned up again, and so on through its life.

<p>Particular instant effects are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is typically tough to identify if the symptoms are a result of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is important to take note of the time and place the signs occur. If the signs fade or go away when a person is far from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort needs to be made to identify indoor air sources that might be possible causes.

The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
