It's type of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there have not bothered with it!

<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same. Once the circuitry is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly solidify and treat-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
