<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services at Prineville OR</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even small window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or washed as conditions necessitate. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
