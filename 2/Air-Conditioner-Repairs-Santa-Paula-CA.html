"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost excellent however Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that might impact the health of people who reside in the house. Toxins could come from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon going into your home from the ground listed below. An air pollutant could also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, unpredictable organic substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or moist carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or personal care products. Viruses and bacteria, family pet dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
