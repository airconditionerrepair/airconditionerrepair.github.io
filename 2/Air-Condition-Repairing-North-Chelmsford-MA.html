<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement..

<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in North Chelmsford MA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here).

So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
