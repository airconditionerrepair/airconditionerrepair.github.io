<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a large central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outside your home. Heat pumps run on electricity and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Many people ignore the extent of the indoor air pollution issue. Air contamination is generally imagined as the black smoke discharged from factories.

<p>Homeowners may likewise presume that because a glowing floor heating system can be viewed (and funded) as a home enhancement, its installation will immediately raise their home's value. No evidence exists suggesting that in-floor heating either favorably or adversely impacts home values.
