<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfy. Other aspects that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges illegal. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the technique as "that German innovation". 29 31 However, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later on Pepsico and others, to create a business union called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take actions to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-404a, R-134a and R-410a are, since 2020, being changed with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and a/c, R-1234yf in vehicles, R-32 in residential air conditioning and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.
