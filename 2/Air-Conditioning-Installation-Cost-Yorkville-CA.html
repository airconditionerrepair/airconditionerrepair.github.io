Counting on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a house can be warmed in cooler months by condensing and transferring energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels found just a couple of feet below ground. In the summer months, the procedure reverses, thus cooling a house by getting rid of heat. Underground temperature remains constant no matter the environment, so geothermal systems supply consistent and dependable heating & cooling.<p>
<p>Before setting up any brand-new heating or cooling system in a home, it is necessary to re reduce the energy and examine load of the house. A more energy effective house will not just lower the cost of a brand-new system and energy expenses, but it will considerably improve the convenience of your home. Before we style and set up any systems, we set up a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will recommend improvements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these improvements. Basic improvements generally consist of adding insulation and air sealing measures. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can recommend a number of certified house Energy Star auditors and installation professionals. Please Contact Us for recommendations.<p>
