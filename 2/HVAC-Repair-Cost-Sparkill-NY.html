<p>The installation was quick, expert and effectively done. The installers were respectful and understood exactly what to do. I am an engineer by profession and recognize easily people who are good at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are great and do not miss out on information that creates a task very well done. I very extremely advise the two gentlemen as they are excellent at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and appreciation for a task well done.<p>
<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the exact same. As soon as the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly cure and solidify-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
