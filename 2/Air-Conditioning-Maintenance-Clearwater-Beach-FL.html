<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material with time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
