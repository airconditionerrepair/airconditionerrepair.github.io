<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Ossian IN?</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
