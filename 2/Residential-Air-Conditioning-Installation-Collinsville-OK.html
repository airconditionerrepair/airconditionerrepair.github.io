<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

Send for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to find out more about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water.
