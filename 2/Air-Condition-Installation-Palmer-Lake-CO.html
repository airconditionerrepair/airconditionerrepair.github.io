<h3>Methods To Get the Most From Your HVAC System at Palmer Lake CO</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
