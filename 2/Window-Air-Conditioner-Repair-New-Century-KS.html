<h3>HVAC System in New Century Kansas</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>To be honest, few of the facilities managers who utilize our indoor air quality tracking service pertained to us because of that.

<p>Another method to reducing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside.
