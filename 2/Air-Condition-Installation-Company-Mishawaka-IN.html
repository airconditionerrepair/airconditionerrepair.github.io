<p>As with the majority of home enhancement jobs, the cost of a complete central heating unit can vary commonly based upon the size of the house. The majority of heaters will last in between 15 and 20 years. In choosing a furnace, property owners must consider heat output and efficiency. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the home.
