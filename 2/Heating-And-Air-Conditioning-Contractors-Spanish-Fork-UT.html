Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of structure products, cigarette smoking, household products, and using unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas stoves or kerosene space heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a variety of purposes in made items.

<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned routinely, they can become blocked with debris that can limit air flow, potentially impacting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Dirty filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down entirely. By contrast, checking and changing a furnace filter can normally be carried out in just a couple of minutes, often with no tools needed. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
