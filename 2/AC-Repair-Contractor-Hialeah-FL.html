<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen gradually because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must suffice until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
