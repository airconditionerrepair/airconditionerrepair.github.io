<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Design, Construction and Commissioning is developed for architects, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other experts worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home include building materials, smoking, home items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas stoves or kerosene area heating units.

<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges illegal. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the technique as "that German technology". 29 31 Nonetheless, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later on Pepsico and others, to create a corporate union called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take steps to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-134a, r-404a and r-410a are, since 2020, being changed with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and cooling, R-1234yf in cars and trucks, R-32 in residential a/c and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.

<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely helpful in collecting info on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to momentarily manage the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day.
