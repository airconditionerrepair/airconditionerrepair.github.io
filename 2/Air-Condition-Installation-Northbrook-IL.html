<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can also worsen indoor air quality issues.

Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
