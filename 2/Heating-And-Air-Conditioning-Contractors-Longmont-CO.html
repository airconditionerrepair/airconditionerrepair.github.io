Winter season utilized to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not simply with newcomers more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle house owners are finally giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>

<p>Immediate impacts might show up after a single direct exposure or repeated direct exposures. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant results are treatable and typically short-term. Sometimes the treatment is merely eliminating the person's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be recognized. Signs of some diseases, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also show up soon after direct exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't shut off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not produce heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place in time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
