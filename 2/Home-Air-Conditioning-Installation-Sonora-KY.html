<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company utilized 98% of the existing material bought with your home. This company introduced a service agreement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and plumbing. Throughout the evaluation on a really cold day they eliminated the furnace claiming health risk factor and contractor laws for their decision. As a new homeowner I have learned how to recognize the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
