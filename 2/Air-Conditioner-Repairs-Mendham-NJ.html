<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
