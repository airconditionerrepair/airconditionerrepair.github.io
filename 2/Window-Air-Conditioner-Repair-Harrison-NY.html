<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and effectively, however to have two significant parts stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<h3>Factors to Consider When Searching for a Fantastic AC Repair Company at Harrison NY</h3>
<p>We are very familiar with the Stock Market volatility at this time and the results that can have on the earnings stream of particular customers. We have actually been working carefully with our Financing Companies and if a new HVAC System is required, there are numerous choices available depending on your need Please ask your Convenience Advisor or Service Personnel about the programs. All funding is used dependent on credit.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.  Second of all like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed skills to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found somebody to appropriately service and the unit has been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Harrison NY</h3>
<p>We got in touch with Elite A/C on one of the hottest days of summer( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out very same day to assess situation & chose to go with them for the work. I enjoy to say that not just did we get the central air conditioning going however likewise changed the heating unit which was old. Everyone we talked with from starting to end were really expert, polite and the work was extremely effectively done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>I am changing our High Velocity System due to the fact that of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an extra $2,818.00 to set up a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>

<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you may pick to change the outdoor compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency system. If you do so, speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the new compressor is correctly matched to the indoor unit. However, thinking about recent modifications in refrigerants and cooling designs, it may be smarter to replace the whole system.<p>
