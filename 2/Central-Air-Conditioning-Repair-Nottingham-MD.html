<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
<p>A SEER score represents Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER rating of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the very same duration. Essentially, SEER provides more data based upon how the EER carries out in different temperatures. The greater the system's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all home appliances.<p>

Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
