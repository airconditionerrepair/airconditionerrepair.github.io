The majority of home heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window ac system with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of pollutants directly from the space where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>

He knew just what the issue was and repaired it very quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
