<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a reference in the future). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
