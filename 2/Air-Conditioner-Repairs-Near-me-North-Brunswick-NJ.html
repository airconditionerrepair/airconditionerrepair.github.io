<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
