<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level.

When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
