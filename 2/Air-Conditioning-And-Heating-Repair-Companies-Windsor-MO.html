<p>Sean was very helpful. He is an extremely pleasant individual to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no issues besides the blower motor. The only factor he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
