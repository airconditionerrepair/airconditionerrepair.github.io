<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to build business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't completion goal. HVAC business owners should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the exact same in all other areas.<p>
