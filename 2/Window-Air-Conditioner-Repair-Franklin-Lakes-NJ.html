<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Franklin Lakes NJ</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
