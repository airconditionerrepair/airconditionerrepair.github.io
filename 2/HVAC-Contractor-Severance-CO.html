The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their overall power must not surpass the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems greater than the outside capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, given that the total capacity of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outside system. Put simply, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that some of the rooms may not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not basic, since it takes into consideration not just the small power of the units, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a large central air conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heatpump run on electrical power and work like ac system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.
