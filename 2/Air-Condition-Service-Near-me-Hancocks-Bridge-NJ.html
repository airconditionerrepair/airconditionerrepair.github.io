This is usually used in a second or third-floor  area and benefits from the floor joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat up.<p>
