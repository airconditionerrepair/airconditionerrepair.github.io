<p>. Prior to picking the installation area of ac system, numerous primary elements need to be considered. First of all, the direction of air circulation from the indoor systems need to not fall on the location of rest or work area.

The outside system must likewise be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be effectively discharged outside and the productivity of the entire system will drop sharply.
