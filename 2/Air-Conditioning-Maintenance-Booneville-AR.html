They include delays in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral issues.

<p>Old lead-based paint is the most considerable source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging direct exposures to lead can be developed when lead-based paint is incorrectly eliminated from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in homes can also arise from lead dust from outside sources, including infected soil tracked inside, and use of lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>If a contractor does not have a strong grasp of local policies or suitable local, regional, and federal incentives-- like the ones discovered at the Database of State Rewards for Renewables and Efficiency, they might leave that to you and subsequently lower their fees considering that they have less paperwork to fret about.
