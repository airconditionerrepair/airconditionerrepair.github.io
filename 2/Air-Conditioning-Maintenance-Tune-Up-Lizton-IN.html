<p>Fantastic service within 24 hr and a reasonable price. The technician (Camryn) was extremely thorough and on-time in describing what services would be carried out. Similarly Camryn provided great customer service at the end of the consultation by explaining precisely what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few ideas of some maintenance jobs we might wish to have done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies employed by some in the market.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>By piping coolant straight into the smaller wall-mounted units, ductless divides enable you to prevent the need for a complete duct system like many other cooling systems need. You will also enjoy a far more flexible system in terms of installation and cost. And due to the fact that each indoor system has its own thermostat, you can say goodbye to thermostat warfare when a single person would choose it a little warmer in a different room.<p>
