<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce toxins.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Over the previous couple of years, there has been some promotion suggesting that houseplants have been shown to reduce levels of some chemicals in laboratory experiments. There is currently no evidence, however, that a reasonable number of houseplants remove significant amounts of pollutants in offices and houses. Due to the fact that excessively damp soil may promote the growth of microorganisms which can affect allergic individuals, indoor houseplants need to not be over-watered.<p>
