An air pollutant might also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, unstable natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or personal care products. Viruses and bacteria, animal dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
