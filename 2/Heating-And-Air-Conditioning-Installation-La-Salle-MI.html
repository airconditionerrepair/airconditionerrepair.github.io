<p>An undersize unit will not have the ability to cool rooms down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit. A large-scale compressor also costs more to run since it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And an oversize system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The result is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In fact, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
