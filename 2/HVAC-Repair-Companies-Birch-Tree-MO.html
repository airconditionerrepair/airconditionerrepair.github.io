A lot of home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house.

Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of contaminants straight from the space where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
