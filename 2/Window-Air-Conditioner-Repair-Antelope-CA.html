However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
