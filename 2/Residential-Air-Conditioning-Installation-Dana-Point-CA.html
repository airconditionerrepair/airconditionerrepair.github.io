<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>

<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Dana Point CA</h3>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest will not come on. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire.
