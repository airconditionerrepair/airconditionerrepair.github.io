<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as a Vital Service in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are rated 90% performance or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern-day furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient.

Modern two- and three-stage heating systems increase performance even further by performing at lower or higher capacity depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>

When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
