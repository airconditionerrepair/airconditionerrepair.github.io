This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product in time.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
