<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
