<p>It is also recommended for citizens of Redmond to have access to heating systems inside their homes. Throughout the winter, heaters supply adequate heating power to houses in the neighborhood. The average daytime temperature highs throughout December, January, and February variety from the mid-40s to low-50s.

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical material gradually. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
