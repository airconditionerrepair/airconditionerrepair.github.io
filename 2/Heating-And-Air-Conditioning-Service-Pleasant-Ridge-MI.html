<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c unit back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, location two 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate great however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
