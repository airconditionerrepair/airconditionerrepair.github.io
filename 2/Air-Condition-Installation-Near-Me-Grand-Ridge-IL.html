<p>These men have been great. At a real estate agent, I often require contractors to give me an opinion for what work on a house may cost. Just recently I required to get in touch with these guys twice. They came out quickly and offered me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer probably wouldn't wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the sincerity. Integrity isn't just their name, it's a business model they take seriously. You people are officially on speed dial. Speak with you soon.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ might notice musty or undesirable smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, frequently referred to as central air" or split-system a/c", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, floors, or ceilings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
