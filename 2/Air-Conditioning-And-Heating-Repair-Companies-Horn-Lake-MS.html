This service can be offered to any commercial customer, not simply during new building.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that an air conditioning system moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept clean. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
