<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have two different systems (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While room air conditioning offers optimum versatility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is normally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
