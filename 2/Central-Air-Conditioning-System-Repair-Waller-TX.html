<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Waller TX</h3>
<p>Particular instant results resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often hard to figure out if the symptoms are an outcome of exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is important to take notice of the time and place symptoms occur. If the signs fade or go away when a person is far from the location, for instance, an effort should be made to recognize indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some effects might be made worse by an inadequate supply of outdoor air coming inside your home or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions prevalent inside.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
