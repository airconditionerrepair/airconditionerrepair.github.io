<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
