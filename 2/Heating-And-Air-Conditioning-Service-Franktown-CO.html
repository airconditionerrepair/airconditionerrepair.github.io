<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC unit than a smaller home, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfy. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a large central air conditioner unit that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps operate on electrical power and work like air conditioning system in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This enables them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like a space heating system) with the same amount of electricity. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<h3>Is Your Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Franktown CO?</h3>
<p>When you and your household walk into your home in Sacramento, CA, are you as comfy as you can be? Do you discover it to be either too cold during the winter season or too warm in locations during the summer? Whether you're having a problem with unequal cooling or heating, or your indoor air quality isn't up to par, Sierra Pacific Home & Convenience, Inc. has the product or services you require.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
