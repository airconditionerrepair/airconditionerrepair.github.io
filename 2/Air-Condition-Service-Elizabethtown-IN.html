<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>There are a couple of possibilities to explain short cycling in really cold weather. The most apparent is the possibility of the high needs put on the system due to the very low temperature levels.

There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. If you need clearness on this problem, contact one of our technicians.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol result, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might go into close-by ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
