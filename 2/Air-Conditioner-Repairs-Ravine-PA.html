<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
