<h3>The Advantages of Buying A New Furnace in Pico Rivera CA</h3>
<p>I was very delighted in the start because things ran efficiently with no sound. Additionally, I saw obvious modifications in my electrical power costs. After 2 years, things began to alter. There have been awkward sounds. I got it checked and fixed. I am hoping that is the end of the issue. Overall, it has been a good experience. Dependable on the whole. Cool operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its looks in the beginning. But then understood Air conditioners are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
