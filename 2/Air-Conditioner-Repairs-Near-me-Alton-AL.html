<p>Volatile natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from products or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could include unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
