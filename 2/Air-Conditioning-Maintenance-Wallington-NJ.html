<p>Re-install the access panel and detach block. Switch on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait on the AC to start (see Be Patient at Startup," listed below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan must spin. If the compressor begins but the fan does not, the fan motor is most likely shot. Turn off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Reinstall the blade and protect the cover. Then see and repower the unit if the fan begins. If  it does not, you've given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
