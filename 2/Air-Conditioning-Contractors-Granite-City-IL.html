Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
