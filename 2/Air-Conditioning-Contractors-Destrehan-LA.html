<p>Professional heating system installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually stop working. HVAC professionals recommend following this standard rule when choosing whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's finest to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air conditioning system is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's ac system are more energy efficient than designs made even 5 years ago, so it makes financial sense to change or update your unit if it's 5 years of ages or older. The best central air conditioner you can purchase today will use 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while providing the very same amount of cooling.<p>
