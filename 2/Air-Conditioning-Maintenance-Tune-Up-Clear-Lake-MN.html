<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
