<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump.

<p>A geothermal heating unit is more dependable than alternatives, and is not affected by any external factors, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power.

You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
