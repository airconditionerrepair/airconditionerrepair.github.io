<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was essential and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the hot water heater because the technicians thought they just didn't seem right and they could not leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>

<p>Through regular usage and the system's existence outside, the coils and fins of the a/c might end up being really filthy. These aspects of the devices are crucial for effective air conditioning. The technician cleans all components, and checks connections to ensure they are safe. The system is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic elements are examineded for proper function and total condition. This is an exceptional opportunity to determine parts that are worn or defective. When the issue is reasonably minor, replacing them to fix the air conditioning might be a lot less expensive.<p>
<p>A fair bit of research study goes into changing or repairing a gas furnace such as choosing the ideal devices and selecting the ideal contractor for the job.

Utilize our helpful HVAC contractor checklist during your HVAC installation to make things much easier on you and your furnace repair person.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside need to be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
