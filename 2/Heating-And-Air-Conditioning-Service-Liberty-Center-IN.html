All circuitry for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is dry and unobstructed.<p>
<p>When you invest in a new heating & cooling system, you're purchasing your home, your household, and your service.
