For example, he may seal gaps and cracks in the external walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs. Insulation might be a more efficient service to your cooling problems than changing your equipment.<p>

<p>Indoor impurities. These include chemicals used in the construction or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook stoves, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops must be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems installed to remove items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can likewise produce particulates and should be vented outside.<p>
