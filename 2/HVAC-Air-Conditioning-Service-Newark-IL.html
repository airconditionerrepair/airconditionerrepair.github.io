<p>Lots of people are ending up being more concerned and conscious about their health and the effect of indoor air quality. Dust and dirt consisting of irritants and contaminants can cover the a/c ductwork with time.

<p>Almost half of Americans use air fresheners at least when a week, and 34 percent use candle lights or incense that frequently, our nationally representative survey found. Roughly 40 percent hardly ever or never ever clean their humidifier or cooking area range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have actually never cleaned up or replaced their furnace filter. And nearly 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can intensify indoor air quality.<p>
