<p>Ventilation plays an essential function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which results in the supply and removal of air from inside a building." Those processes include bringing in outside air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air exterior. The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
