<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of contaminants that have the potential to adversely affect your health-- impurities such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and extremely small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor ought to assess and, if necessary, upgrade the building envelope. For instance, he may seal spaces and cracks in the outer walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs. Insulation might be a more effective option to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>
<p>A SEER rating represents Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER rating of a system is the cooling output at varying temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the same duration.

The greater the system's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER score can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all home appliances.<p>

<p>Due to the fact that a task such as this is going to require a somewhat extensive quantity of work it is suggested that a house owner request a number of estimates from a range of contractors. The best times of the year to do such a task are in the months in which homes are not utilizing their heater. This will typically enable the work to be finished rapidly and the house owner to get the best rates available. It is also important to ensure that a contractor will talk about the tax advantages of an upgrade to an efficient heating unit, and even aid with documentation and documentation.<p>
<p>There is a necessary balance in making your decision though as systems with greater AFUE ratings typically feature greater price tags. So, make certain to choose based on how often you will utilize your heater, the load that will be placed on it and the frequency with which you intend on having it serviced each year.

Throughout high use months, examine the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
