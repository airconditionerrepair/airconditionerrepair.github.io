<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace specialists typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your home still heats to the ideal temperature level. The temperature of the air produced by the heatpump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel extremely hot. If your house is not heating up, only be worried. Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working correctly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you ought to contact a professional to check and repair the system.<p>

<p>Another option to oil heaters are gas furnaces While oil is typically utilized in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have an option in between the 2 types.
