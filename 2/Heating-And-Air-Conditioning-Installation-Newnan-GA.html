Due to these reasons, the job growth for this occupation is higher than average.<p>
<p>Both should be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
