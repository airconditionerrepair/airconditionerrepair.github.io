<p>Many indoor air contaminants originate from the kitchen area. Gas stoves release damaging impurities, including carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide. Even electric burners produce those exact same contaminants in lower levels, as well as other particles that can be quickly absorbed into your bloodstream. So, when you're cooking, be sure to switch on your cooking area vents, or open a window to help filter out the air much more.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a routine oil change in your vehicle. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter better traps impurities and particles in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. During high use months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>
