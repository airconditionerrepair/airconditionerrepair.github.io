"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

Currently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) requirements but it does supply guidelines about the most common IAQ office problems.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, indicating they utilize air to exchange heat, in the exact same way as an automobile radiator or typical family a/c unit does.
