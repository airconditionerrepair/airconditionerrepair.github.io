<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your home won't heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Pearl River NY</h3>

Just like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE OFFICER). COP rates how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to produce the heating or cooling result. Most ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this indicates is that for each system of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, roughly 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the kind of heat.<p>
