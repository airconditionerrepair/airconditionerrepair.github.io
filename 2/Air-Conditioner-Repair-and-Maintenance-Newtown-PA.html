The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
