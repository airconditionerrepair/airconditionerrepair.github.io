<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ might observe musty or undesirable smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues.

However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>
