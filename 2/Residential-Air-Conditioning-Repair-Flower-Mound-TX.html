<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major devices manufacturer's to ensure your factory guarantees remain in place. Additionally, the tangible outcomes of a PM is often hard to quantify, as one response stated the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or a/c unit don't just break at the breeze of a finger, however rather is the result of recurring use of a part that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering early deterioration, causing holes and fractures.
