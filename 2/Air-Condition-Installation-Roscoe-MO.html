<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor unit as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures via mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
