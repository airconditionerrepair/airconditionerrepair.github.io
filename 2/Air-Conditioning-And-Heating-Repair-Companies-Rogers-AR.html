<h3>HVAC Technician in Rogers Arkansas</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the property.<p>

<p>A/c unit can develop a great deal of water due to the fact that they eliminate moisture from the air.
