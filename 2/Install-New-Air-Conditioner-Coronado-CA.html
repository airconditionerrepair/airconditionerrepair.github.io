These convection heating systems are still extensively used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned regularly, they can end up being clogged with particles that can limit air flow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Dirty filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases trigger the system to close down entirely.

As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
