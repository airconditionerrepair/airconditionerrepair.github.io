<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- offer All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work effectively in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Working on electricity, a heatpump is an affordable solution utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, however in reverse. Instead of warming or cooling the air already inside your home, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and pushes it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>
<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in efficiency advantage because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Because they do not need any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Due to the fact that a system is set up in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>
