<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
