A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing products is frequently recommended instead.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
