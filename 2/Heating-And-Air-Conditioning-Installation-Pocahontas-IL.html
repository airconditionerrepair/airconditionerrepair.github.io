<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a reasonably easy to determine surrogate for indoor contaminants emitted by people, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are uncommonly high inside your home may cause residents to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in the majority of structures.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
