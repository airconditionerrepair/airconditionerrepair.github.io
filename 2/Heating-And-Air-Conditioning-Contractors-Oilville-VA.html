<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Oilville Virginia</h3>
<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC system is frosty. Likewise, if the a/c unit smells bad, there could be bacteria accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil soaks up the heat away from your house. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the air conditioning unit's evaporator coil.<p>

<p>As with the majority of home enhancement jobs, the cost of a full central heater can differ widely based upon the size of the home. Most heaters will last in between 15 and 20 years.
