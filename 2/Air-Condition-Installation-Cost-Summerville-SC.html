<p>A specific ac system that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the very same air course. A standard a/c unit transfers heat energy out of the room due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside. Nevertheless, considering that all components of the dehumidifier remain in the same space, no heat is eliminated. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is really heated, just as by an electric heating system that draws the same amount of power.<p>
