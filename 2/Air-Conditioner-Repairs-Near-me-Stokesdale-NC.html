<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Indoor impurities. These include chemicals utilized in the building or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these appliances (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor contaminants.
