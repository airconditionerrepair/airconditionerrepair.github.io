<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
