<h3>AC Duct Repair in Medical Lake WA</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must look out for. First, you need to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
