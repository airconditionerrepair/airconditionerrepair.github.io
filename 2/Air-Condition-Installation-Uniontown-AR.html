<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product gradually.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
