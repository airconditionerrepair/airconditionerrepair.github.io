<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can also intensify indoor air quality issues. The HVAC system may be polluted (due to the fact that of mold in duct lining or bacteria on coil or filters, for example), and the system might spread these contaminants throughout the house.

<h3>Geothermal Heating And Cooling in Gold Hill Oregon</h3>
<p>Lots of people underestimate the extent of the indoor air contamination problem. Air pollution is usually pictured as the black smoke released from factories. Little thought is offered to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays, paints, cleaners, and pesticides utilized in the home. To compound the problem, it is approximated that the average American invests 70 percent to 90 percent of his/her time inside, and majority that time is spent in the house.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>In more complex schemes, warm air is allowed to rise and flow out high building openings to the outside (stack effect ), triggering cool outdoors air to be drawn into low building openings. Natural ventilation schemes can utilize extremely little energy, but care needs to be taken to ensure comfort. In warm or damp environments, maintaining thermal comfort entirely via natural ventilation may not be possible. Air conditioning systems are utilized, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers likewise use outdoors air to condition areas, however do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outdoor air when appropriate.<p>

The state of California has the authority to manage indoor appliances through codes, and after more powerful guidelines are set there is a chance to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 should be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements used for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may also be required.<p>
