<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While installing a separate split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more problems, given that a few of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the a/c individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>

<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>
