<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema.
