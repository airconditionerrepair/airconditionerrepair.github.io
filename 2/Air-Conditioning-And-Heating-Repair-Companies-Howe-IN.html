They include delays in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, kids, and babies are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups given that lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead. Kids might have higher exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
