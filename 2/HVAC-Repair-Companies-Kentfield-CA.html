CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from badly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which might go into nearby ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical centers and retirement home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside water fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
