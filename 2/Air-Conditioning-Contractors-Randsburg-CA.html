Supervisors with BPI accreditation understand that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as just one aspect (out of many) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>Volatile natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from items or processes; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water use.<p>
<p>HVAC is an abbreviation for Heating, air and ventilation Conditioning, and describes the environment control systems installed in houses or commercial homes. Their task is to move heated or cooled filtered air throughout the structure, to keep occupants of the structure comfy. Literally every structure in Columbus or Franklin County, Ohio or the United States has some sort of environment control system installed.<p>
