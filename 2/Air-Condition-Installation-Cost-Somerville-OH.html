All the wet hot air that travels through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then eliminated from the space that is being cooled. If your HVAC system is not draining properly, you'll have a water leak. A restriction in your drainage pipelines triggers a water leakage. There are several locations an obstruction can happen. Among the main areas where obstructions start to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>

Often, specific contaminants like dust from building and construction or restoration, mold, cleaning products, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (including small amounts of chemicals released as a gas gradually) might trigger bad IAQ.<p>
