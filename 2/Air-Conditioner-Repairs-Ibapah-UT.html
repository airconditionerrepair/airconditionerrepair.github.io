<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, offices and houses matters, especially considering that we spend the majority of our lives inside your home. Ac system help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in very damp climates or in cases where the a/c unit is extra-large, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioner will require more energy to cool your house.
