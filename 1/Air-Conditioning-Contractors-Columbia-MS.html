<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
