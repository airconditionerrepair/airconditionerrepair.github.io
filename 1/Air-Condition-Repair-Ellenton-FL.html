<h3>Air Condition Installation Cost in Ellenton Florida</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>
<p>Some health effects might appear shortly after a single direct exposure or duplicated exposures to a contaminant. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate results are generally short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is merely removing the person's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Not long after exposure to some indoor air contaminants, symptoms of some diseases such as asthma might show up, be exacerbated or worsened.<p>
