<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off totally.<p>
