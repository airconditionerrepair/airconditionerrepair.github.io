<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a big central air conditioner system that sits outdoors your home. Heat pumps operate on electrical energy and work like air conditioners in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This enables them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating unit (like an area heating unit) with the very same amount of electrical power. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
