<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit increase. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
