<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives ask for assessment and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms.

<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area.
