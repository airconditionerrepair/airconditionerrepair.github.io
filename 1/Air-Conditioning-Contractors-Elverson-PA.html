<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Producers guarantee would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Also they detected the issue and fixed extremely rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>There is no easy response, but lots of utilize the general rule that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is probably a better solution.
