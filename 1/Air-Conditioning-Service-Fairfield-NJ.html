<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.. Secondly like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found someone to effectively service and the system has been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years.
