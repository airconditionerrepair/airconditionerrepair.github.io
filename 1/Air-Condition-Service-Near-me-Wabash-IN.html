<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, however lots of utilize the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is most likely a better service. If the existing system has actually not incurred other major repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and problems that led to the breakdown can be determined and fixed, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense also.<p>
