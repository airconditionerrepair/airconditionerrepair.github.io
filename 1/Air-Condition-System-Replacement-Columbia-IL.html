<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. Over time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors altered to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Since immunity varies greatly from private to specific, it is not useful to create a universal guideline fit for all in terms of direct exposure and health. EDLab at Pure Air Control Services carried out a 10 year research study analyzing more than 7,000 buildings and over 25,000 environmental samples that were collected throughout the United States and abroad. The structure type included both commercial and residential. The majority of samples examined were checked favorable for fungis and bacteria.<p>
