<p>All houses require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been stressed out from use. Another possible factor could be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adapting to the appropriate temperature level. Furnaces that kick on often might be due to a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>
