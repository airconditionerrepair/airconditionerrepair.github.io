If you've set up the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
