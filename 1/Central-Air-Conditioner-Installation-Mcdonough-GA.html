<p>Strategy on investing several thousand dollars for the complete system if you are considering setting up a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your home. The size of the system determines the labor hours involved to build the system.

<p>Next, and maybe just as important when it comes to central air expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, however will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air.
