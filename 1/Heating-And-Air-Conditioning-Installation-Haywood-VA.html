This process needs to be duplicated typically to secure the HVAC system from extreme damage.<p>
<p>Similar to houses, the most essential factor influencing indoor air quality is the presence of contaminant sources. Typically found office toxins and their sources. consist of environmental tobacco smoke; asbestos from insulating and fire-retardant structure materials; formaldehyde from pressed wood products; other organics from building products, carpet, and other office furnishings, cleaning activities and products, toilet air fresheners, paints, adhesives, copying machines, and photography and print shops; biological contaminants from filthy ventilation systems or water-damaged walls, ceilings, and carpets; and pesticides from pest management practices.<p>
