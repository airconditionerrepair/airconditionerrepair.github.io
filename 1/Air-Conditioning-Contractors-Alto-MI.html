<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable higher airflow from the outdoors, air quality tracking platforms and sensing units, and brand-new air filtration innovations are becoming more common as available services in residential and commercial HVAC product packages.

<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system likewise may contribute to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed on a regular basis might become clogged up, lowering air flow quality, volume, and circulation.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to offer sufficient changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
