The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to offer car debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement..
