Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot.

This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioner into a heatpump While space a/c offers optimum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is normally more pricey than central air.<p>
