<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered by a Leawood KS HVAC Company</h3>
<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by utilizing smart technology. Martin stated the company can develop a dashboard within the structure's controls that will provide information on its systems to allow for actual time presence, supplying the ability to be preventative rather than reactionary. This service can be supplied to any commercial customer, not just during brand-new building.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot beside the radiators.
