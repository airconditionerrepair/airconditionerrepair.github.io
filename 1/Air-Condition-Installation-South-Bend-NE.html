<p>Many individuals underestimate the extent of the indoor air pollution problem. Air contamination is usually imagined as the black smoke released from factories. Little idea is offered to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, pesticides, cleaners, and paints used in the home. To compound the issue, it is approximated that the average American invests 70 percent to 90 percent of his or her time indoors, and over half that time is spent in the house.<p>
<p>We're spending a lot more time inside your home, nowadays. While many individuals presume pollution is just an outdoor problem, your home (and workplace) can also be polluted. As a society, we make sure that our houses are well-sealed and well-insulated, however we do not think enough about direct exposure to all the things we place in our houses," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a big result on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, dizziness, queasiness-- immediately, they can begin years after direct exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA). Here's how to breathe easier.<p>
<p>Even after performing these jobs to increase the effectiveness and longevity of your Seattle HVAC system, you should call in a professional to tackle issues quickly when they develop and carry out in-depth maintenance once a year or as required.
