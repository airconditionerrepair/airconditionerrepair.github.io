<p>The exhaust outlets allow all dangerous gases to leave your home so there's no dangerous buildup of carbon monoxide and other such gases. If the exhaust outlets are obstructed, they can result in an unsafe accumulation and jeopardize your security.

If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the element.  a very advantageous outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
