Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be turned off completely.<p>
