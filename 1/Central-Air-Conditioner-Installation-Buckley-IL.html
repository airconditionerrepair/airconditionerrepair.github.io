<p>Trace was the service technician that looked after my semi yearly maintenance today. Trace was on time, considerate, and respected my home by always using boot coverings when entering my home.

<p>As with homes, the most crucial factor influencing indoor air quality is the existence of contaminant sources. Frequently found office toxins and their sources. include environmental tobacco smoke; asbestos from insulating and fire-retardant structure materials; formaldehyde from pushed wood products; other organics from developing materials, carpet, and other workplace home furnishings, cleaning activities and products, bathroom air fresheners, paints, adhesives, photocopier, and photography and printing shop; biological pollutants from filthy ventilation systems or water-damaged walls, ceilings, and carpets; and pesticides from pest management practices.<p>
<p>Air conditioners can develop a lot of water because they eliminate moisture from the air. To eliminate this, they have an usually plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the system or flood the area. To deal with condensate issues, please see A/c Leaks Water, below.<p>

On top of that, ductless A/cs can raise and lower their temperature quickly, conserving you energy and cash that routine HVAC compressors will waste by continuously launching and turning themselves off.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance items that just a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, however a house owner doesn't have the abilities or tools required to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and appropriate airflow are important to a well-functioning system, however property owners lack the needed devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
