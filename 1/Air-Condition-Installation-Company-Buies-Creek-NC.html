<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by individuals and animals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander.
