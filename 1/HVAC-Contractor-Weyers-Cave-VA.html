<h3>The Function of the Boiler Burner at Weyers Cave VA</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely happy that someone as skilled as Adam had the ability to return and repair the air conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to check the a/c unit before you buy. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to evaluate AC systems even in winter. We want we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
