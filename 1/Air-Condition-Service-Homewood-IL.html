<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heating systems have several control boards. The biggest, or just one in some furnaces, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the brand-new control board must be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t properly identified, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when set up. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a professional to diagnose.<p>
