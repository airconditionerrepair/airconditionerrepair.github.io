<p>A geothermal heating system does not create its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as gas, coal, or oil. Rather, it takes in heat from within the earth. Additionally, a geothermal heating & cooling system utilizes substantially less electrical energy compared to a basic electric heat-resistance heat pump. This makes a geothermal heating system an attractive solution to cut your carbon footprint, offering a favorable impact on the environment.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as a vehicle radiator or normal household air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outdoors air.<p>
