<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the standard water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>

<p>A geothermal heating unit is more trusted than alternatives, and is not impacted by any external aspects, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar energy. For instance, wind energy can only be utilized when there is wind, while solar energy depends on regular sunshine to work efficiently. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the wind nor the sun, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a dependable and offered source of energy.<p>
