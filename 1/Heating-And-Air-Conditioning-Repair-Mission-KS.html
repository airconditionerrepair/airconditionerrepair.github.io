<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps at Mission KS</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
