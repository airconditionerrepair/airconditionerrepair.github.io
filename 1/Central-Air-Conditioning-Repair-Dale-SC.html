<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power needs to not surpass the capacity of the outside system. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems greater than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, considering that the overall capability of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outside system. Basically, the outside system will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that a few of the spaces might not have a really comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not simple, considering that it takes into account not only the nominal power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as simply glowing systems.

When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the approach is described as radiant heat.<p>
