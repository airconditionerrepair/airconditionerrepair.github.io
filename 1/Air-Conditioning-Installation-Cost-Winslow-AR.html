Depending upon the kind of unit installed, it can be noisy and cause issues if you're highly adverse dust.

<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ might observe unpleasant or musty odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for excellent structure management.<p>
