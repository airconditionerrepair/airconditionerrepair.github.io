<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a recommendation in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
