<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is taken in from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
