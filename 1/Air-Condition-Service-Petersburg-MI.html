<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Since the 1980s, producers of HVAC devices have been making an effort to make the systems they make more efficient. This was originally driven by rising energy expenses, and has more just recently been driven by increased awareness of ecological problems.

There are several techniques for making HVAC systems more effective.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>

The technician who described our options did an excellent job in making sure we understood the pros and cons of each choice. The service technicians who installed the new system were fast and professional, while taking time to make sure we understood how the new system worked. In general a very first rate experience.<p>
