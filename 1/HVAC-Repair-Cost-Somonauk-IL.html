<p>In houses, the most substantial sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pressed wood products made using adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood products made for indoor use include: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furniture); hardwood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiberboard contains a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood item and is typically acknowledged as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood item.<p>
