<p>All homes require effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the correct temperature level. Heaters that kick on frequently might be due to an unclean filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal issue.
