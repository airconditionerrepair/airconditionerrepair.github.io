<h3>Ductwork Installation in Monroe NC</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me concerning an abnormally high costs that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had actually identified the problem location in looking over the costs.

I have considered All Points a company with stability for the 9 years we have used them. This experience validates that.<p>
