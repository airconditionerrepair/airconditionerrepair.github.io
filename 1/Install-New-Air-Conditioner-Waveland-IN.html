Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
