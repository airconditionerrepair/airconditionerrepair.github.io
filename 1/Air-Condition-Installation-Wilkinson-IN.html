<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single family houses, apartment, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large commercial and office complex such as skyscrapers and medical facilities, vehicles such as automobiles, trains, planes, submarines and ships, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are regulated with respect to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine elements. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs managed by experts, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, typically referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system air conditioning", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floors, or walls covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioning system to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
