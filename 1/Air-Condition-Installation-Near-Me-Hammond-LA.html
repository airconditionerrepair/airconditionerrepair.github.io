<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical product with time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
