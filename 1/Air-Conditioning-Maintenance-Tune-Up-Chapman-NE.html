<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
