<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Buhl ID</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the task based only on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few affordable ones got. Others were almost two times the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install group was considerate of my home and set up the devices in the expected quantity of time. post install inspection outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 system it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
