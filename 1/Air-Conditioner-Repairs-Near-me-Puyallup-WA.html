<h3>Electric Furnace in Puyallup WA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

Jeremiah Bartula the plumbing professional discussed our options prior to our work with Brian and was incredible, helpful and useful - his work was impeccable! All of his assistants were conscientious and respectful. The work website was left entirely cleared and cleaned.
