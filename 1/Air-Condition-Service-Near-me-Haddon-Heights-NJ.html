<p>A packaged unit, typically set up on the roofing system, is most frequently used on commercial structures, but it is also a choice for house owners to think about. Often times, these units consist of not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those looking to save money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, considering that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are usually only offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best alternative for homeowners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
