To ensure the system you pick is the right size for your house, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load calculation estimate to identify the precise kind of heat and a/c system that's ideal for your home-we do not simply change it with the exact same size unit you presently have. These estimations consider things such as the size of your home, its exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more.

<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems.

Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
