<h3>AC Duct Repair in Cloverport KY</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect having to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
