Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>

Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
