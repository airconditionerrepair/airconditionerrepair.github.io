<p>Similar to the majority of house improvement tasks, the cost of a complete central heating unit can differ extensively based upon the size of the house. A lot of heaters will last between 15 and 20 years. In choosing a furnace, property owners need to consider heat output and efficiency. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace ought to be matched to the size of the house. A little home, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the house too quickly and shut down for too long, resulting in irregular temperature levels.<p>
