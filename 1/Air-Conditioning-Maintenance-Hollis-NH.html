<h3>What to Look for When Selecting an Hollis NH HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>Sean was very useful. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
