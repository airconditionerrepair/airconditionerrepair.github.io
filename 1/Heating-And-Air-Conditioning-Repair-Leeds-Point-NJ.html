An option to packaged systems is the use of separate indoor and outdoor coils in split systems Split systems are chosen and commonly used worldwide other than in North America. In North America, split systems are frequently seen in residential applications, however they are acquiring appeal in small commercial buildings. The split systems are an excellent choice for little buildings where ductwork is not practical or where the space conditioning performance is of prime concern. 19 The advantages of ductless a/c systems include simple installation, no ductwork, higher zonal control, versatility of control and quiet operation. citation required In space conditioning, the duct losses can represent 30% of energy consumption. 20 Using minisplit can result in energy cost savings in area conditioning as there are no losses related to ducting.<p>

<h3>AC Maintenance in Leeds Point New Jersey</h3>
<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and location of pollutant exposure. An example of time control is setting up flooring stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday.

Area control involves moving the toxin source far from occupants or even transferring prone residents.<p>
