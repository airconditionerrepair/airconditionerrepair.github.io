<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not use automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason that your company can not provide this.
