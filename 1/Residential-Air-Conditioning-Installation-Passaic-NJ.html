<p>Unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from products or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might consist of unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to provide enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
