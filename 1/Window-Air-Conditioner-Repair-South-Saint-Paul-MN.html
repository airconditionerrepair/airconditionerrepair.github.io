The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>An undersize system will not have the ability to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run because it needs to run longer than a correctly sized system. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate because it simply takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a chance to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In reality, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
