<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
