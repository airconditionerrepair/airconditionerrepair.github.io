Their techs are extremely educated and expert. Costs are reasonable. Always on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff installed a brand-new air handler and condenser this week. Since the cost was obviously sensible, I did not bother to get rival's quotes because of my rely on Waychoff.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
