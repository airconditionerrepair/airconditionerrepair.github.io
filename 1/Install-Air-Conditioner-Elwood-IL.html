<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost terrific but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized.
