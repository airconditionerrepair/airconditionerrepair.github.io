<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely pleased that someone as experienced as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioning unit before you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to check AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had known him then.<p>

<p>Central air systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it means the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>

<p>When they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, most Midtown Houston Tx customers do not know why their HVAC system is not working. The copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you remain in luck, that's more than likely your problem. The next step is to thaw your air conditioning equipment if you found that your conditioning filter requires replacing. The most convenient way to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
