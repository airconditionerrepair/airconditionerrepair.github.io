<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your home that perfect temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those common air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it likewise wears down your AC system, which can cause costly repairs down the road. So, make sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get a cooling service plan which typically includes a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless poisonous gas. Because it is difficult to see, smell or taste, CO can kill you before you know it is in your home.

The effects of CO direct exposure can differ significantly from person to individual depending upon age, overall health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
