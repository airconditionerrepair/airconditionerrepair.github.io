<h3>How To Choose An HVAC Company at London AR</h3>
<p>When building your new home a well-functioning Heating and Cooling system is essential, in addition to the air quality you breathe inside. We have the experience and resources necessary to assist from the planning stages through to the final installation. We use the most recent software to assist create your ductwork system and use the greatest quality materials in the building and construction and installation.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
