<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house will not heat up.

Just like other types of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). COP rates how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to create the heating or cooling impact. Most ground source heat pumps have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0.
