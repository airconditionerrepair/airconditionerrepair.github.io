<p>All houses need effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the right temperature. Furnaces that kick on frequently might be due to a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>

<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
