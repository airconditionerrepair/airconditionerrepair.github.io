<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from use. Another possible factor might be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the proper temperature level.
