<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Milpitas CA</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really pleased that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to check the air conditioner prior to you buy. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to check AC units even in winter. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
