The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, however it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
