<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce contaminants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside need to be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
