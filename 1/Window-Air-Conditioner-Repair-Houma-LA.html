How do I know. I now work as a specialist to validate the so called solutions and problems. 9 out of 10, I check are completely incorrect.<p>
<p>There is a needed balance in making your choice though as systems with greater AFUE rankings typically come with higher price tags. So, ensure to decide based on how typically you will use your heater, the load that will be placed on it and the frequency with which you intend on having it serviced each year.
