<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
