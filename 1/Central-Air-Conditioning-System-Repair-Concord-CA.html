<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate excellent however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<h3>Factors to Consider When Searching for a Good AC Repair Company at Concord CA</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the task based only on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few sensible ones received. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex effectively encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up group was respectful of my home and installed the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post set up inspection results look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 system it changed (likewise Carrier).<p>
