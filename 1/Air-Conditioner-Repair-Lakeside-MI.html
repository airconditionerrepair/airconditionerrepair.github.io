<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing at Lakeside MI</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electrical power open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>

<h3>Furnace Repair Near Me in Lakeside MI</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
