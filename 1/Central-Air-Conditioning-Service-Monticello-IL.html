<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, look for indications of problems with the ventilation in your home.

To spot odors in your house, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether smells are noticeable.<p>
