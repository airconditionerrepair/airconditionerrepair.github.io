<p>Prior to installing any new heating or cooling system in a home, it is necessary to re minimize the energy and assess load of the house. A more energy efficient house will not just decrease the cost of a brand-new system and utility costs, however it will considerably improve the convenience of your home. Before we design and install any systems, we schedule a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will recommend improvements and make estimates for cost and energy savings from these improvements. Basic enhancements normally include adding insulation and air sealing steps. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can suggest a number of qualified house Energy Star auditors and installation professionals. Please Contact United States for references.<p>

<p>Part of the building process is installing heater for brand-new developments, however existing structures often need to have heating systems installed too.

This is particularly true of older systems that are not energy efficient. No one likes getting a whopper of an utility bill. These are points we help you compare before choices are made about repairing an older system or setting up a newer system. Our desire is to help you decide that is best for your heating needs.<p>
<p>Though it may be hard to believe, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air outside.
