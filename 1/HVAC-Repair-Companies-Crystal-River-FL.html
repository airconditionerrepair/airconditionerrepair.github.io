<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
