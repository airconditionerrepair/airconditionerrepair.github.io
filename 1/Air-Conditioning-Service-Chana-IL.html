<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>In addition, employee health signs such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, irritation, and irregular breathing might be induced as the result of temperature extremes, inappropriate humidity levels, and too much or too little air blood circulation. Work environment temperatures need to be maintained in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts brought on by too much air blood circulation need to be prevented.<p>

Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-effective method to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses.
