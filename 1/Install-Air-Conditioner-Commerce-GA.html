Many typical structure products used prior to 1975 include asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Usually, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the building products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure renovation. Removal of asbestos-containing products is not constantly optimum because the fibers can be spread out into the air throughout the elimination procedure. A management program for intact asbestos-containing products is often recommended instead.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).
