<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
