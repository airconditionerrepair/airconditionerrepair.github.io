<p>Making use of air filters can trap a few of the air contaminants. The Department of Energy's Energy Effectiveness and Renewable resource section suggests that "Air Filtering must have a Minimum Effectiveness Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as figured out by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are used to minimize the quantity of dust that reaches the damp coils. Dust can function as food to grow molds on the damp coils and ducts and can reduce the performance of the coils.<p>
<p>In an area where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good primary heating systems. You'll wish to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperature levels reach freezing. Your heating technician can install controls which automatically closed down the heat pump if temperatures reach and drop below freezing. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, effectively heating the house in these conditions.<p>
<p>Re-install the access panel and detach block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Client at Startup," listed below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan need to spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor starts but the fan does not. Shut down the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover.
