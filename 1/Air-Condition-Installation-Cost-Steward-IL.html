<p>I am really satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour.

I'm likewise impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.

<p>Central air conditioners, often described as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floorings, or walls covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
