<h3>Ductwork Repair and Replacement in Crawfordsville Indiana</h3>
<p>Furnaces are like vehicles. As they age, you can change one part only require another part replaced or repaired next year. It doesn't take long to invest $500 just to keep an old oil or gas furnace running. Furnaces incur the most breakdowns in the last 2 years of their lives. Another repair sign is whether you had to wait to get parts replaced. As a furnace ages, it gets harder to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be actually cold on a below no night.<p>

<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace in Crawfordsville IN?</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in vehicles in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, however is still imported and can be bought and utilized by certified HVAC service technicians. For systems requiring just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by lots of people.<p>
