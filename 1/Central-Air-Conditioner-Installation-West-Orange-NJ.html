<p>The purpose of many structure ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for resident convenience while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing safety at affordable energy expenses. Load calculating is described as the Handbook J computation and must be carried out by the HVAC contractor before giving an installation or system cost for a/c.
