<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Louisa VA Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>Lots of Canadian jurisdictions do not have specific legislation that handles indoor air quality issues. In the absence of such legislation, the "general responsibility stipulation" uses. This stipulation, common to all Canadian occupational health and wellness legislation, states that an employer should offer a healthy and safe workplace. Therefore, making sure the air is of excellent quality is the employer's task.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
