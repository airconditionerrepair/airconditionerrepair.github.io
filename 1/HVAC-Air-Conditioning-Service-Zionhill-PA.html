<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most budget-friendly if your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in costly compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the tools or abilities required to check refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and proper air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, but property owners lack the needed devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still required to have a professional technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
