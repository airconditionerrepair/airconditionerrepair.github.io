<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Make sure there are no rugs, furniture, or anything else restricting the circulation of air. Not only will obstructed vents and registers affect your convenience, they can also lead to duct leakages due to excessive air pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and registers in unused rooms is NOT a great concept. You will not save any money and will wind up causing more issues for your heating system.<p>
<p>Use specialists and treat them well: Encouraged, well-compensated experts carry out much better work than transient subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success. Since they're cheap, an ethical company does not make use of inexpensive labor opportunities just. Inexpensive workmanship is typically substandard workmanship, and it never ever assists a company develop long-lasting relationships with customers.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may wish to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump units can have various heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a house heating unit, you may try to find a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capability and performance.
