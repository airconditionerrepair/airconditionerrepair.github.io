<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity professional at a large merchant who asked not to be named because he did not have authorization to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a team that consistently keeps an eye on energy usage and temperature levels in stores to save money on expenses (especially in the evening) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the shops vary outside of an acceptable variety that could prevent consumers from shopping at the shop.<p>
