<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity professional at a large seller who asked not to be called because he did not have approval to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a group that routinely keeps an eye on energy consumption and temperatures in stores to save on expenses (particularly at night) and to alert store managers if temperatures in the shops change outside of an acceptable range that could avoid consumers from shopping at the shop.<p>
