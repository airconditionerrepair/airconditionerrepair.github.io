<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.
