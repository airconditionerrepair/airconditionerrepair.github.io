<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit boost. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
