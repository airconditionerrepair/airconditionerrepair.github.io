<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to offer heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c unit into a heatpump While space a/c offers optimum versatility, when utilized to cool numerous spaces at a time it is generally more expensive than central air.<p>
