<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace professionals typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan.

Unscrew the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Picture 6).<p>
