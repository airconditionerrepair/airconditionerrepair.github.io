<p>Oil heaters tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which needs to be effectively vented and cleaned up from the furnace regularly.

Expect to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, alter your filters every 1 - 3 months, and tidy your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
