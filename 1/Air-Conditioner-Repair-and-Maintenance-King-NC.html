<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
