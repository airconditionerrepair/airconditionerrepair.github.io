<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. Connection issues along the line that supplies power to your furnace can jeopardize the performance of the system.

Take some time to examine these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are tight and secure.<p>
