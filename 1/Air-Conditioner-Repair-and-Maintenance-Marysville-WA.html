We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the same pollutants. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>The very first a/c and refrigerators used poisonous or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might result in deadly mishaps when they dripped.

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
