<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you should watch out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
