If we do choose to offer auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There need to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
