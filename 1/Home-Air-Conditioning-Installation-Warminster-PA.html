<p>If you think a mold issue-- either since of visible growth or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check. Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
