<p>A/c can also be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>

<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
