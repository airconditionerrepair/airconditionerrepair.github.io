<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
