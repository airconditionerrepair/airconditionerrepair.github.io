<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals used in the construction or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these appliances (cook stoves, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops should be used with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices need to be sealed and power-vented systems set up to eliminate items of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also develop particulates and must be vented outside.<p>
