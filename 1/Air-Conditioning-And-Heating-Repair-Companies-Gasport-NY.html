<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary problem. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more difficulties, since some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
