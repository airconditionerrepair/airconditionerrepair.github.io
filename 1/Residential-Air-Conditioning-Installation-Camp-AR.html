<p>I'll start with a gas furnace since it's the most common heating unit in Seattle homes. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is gathered via cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for performance. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably simple process.

<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank.
