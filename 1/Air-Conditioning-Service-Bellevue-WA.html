<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
