<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
