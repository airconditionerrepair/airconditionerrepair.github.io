<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Convected heat systems have been around because the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floorings and connected them into a hot water supply. Romans utilized a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and a primary pumping maker to flow warm water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the uniformity of the floor heat transferred heat to other posts in the rooms, including the human occupants.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>

<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Stevens PA</h3>
