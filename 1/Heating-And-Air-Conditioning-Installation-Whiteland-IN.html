<p>All houses require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from use. Another possible factor might be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the correct temperature. Heating systems that kick on regularly may be because of a filthy filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>
