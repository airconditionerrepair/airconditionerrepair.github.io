Other elements that can impact this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit, think about potential impacts of indoor air contamination. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, especially instructions on the correct fuel and keeping the heater effectively adjusted. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is usually an indicator of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heater remains in use, open a door from the room where the heating system is located to the rest of the home and open a window a little.<p>
