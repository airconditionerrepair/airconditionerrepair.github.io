<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
