<p>Measurement procedures are being developed and demonstrated to examine building ventilation and indoor toxin concentrations. These procedures range from advanced tracer gas techniques used predominantly in building research efforts to less involved procedures that can be used by developing operators. NIST scientists are continually establishing brand-new test treatments, and after that showing them in the field to assess their expediency and reliability. The efforts in which these treatments are demonstrated in the field has actually led to the advancement of an important database of structure ventilation and indoor air quality performance.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. Try a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits.<p>
<p>If your single phase air conditioner isn't old enough to justify replacement, consider a whole home dehumidifier. By installing dehumidification equipment inside an existing single stage system, you can take pleasure in some of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without replacing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, enhancing indoor air quality and allowing greater comfort at higher temperature levels.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
