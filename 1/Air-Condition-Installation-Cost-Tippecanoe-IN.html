<p>In houses, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pressed wood products made using adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood products made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furniture); wood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard contains a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood product and is normally acknowledged as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood item.<p>

<p>Irritants are materials that trigger an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Irritants found in indoor air are mostly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can end up being air-borne, and therefore, are quickly breathed in. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the presence of cat irritant could cause an asthma attack in people with feline allergies, but not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless harmful gas. Since it is difficult to see, taste or smell, CO can eliminate you before you understand it is in your house. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO triggers moderate effects that are frequently mistaken for the influenza. These signs include headaches, dizziness, nausea, fatigue and disorientation. The impacts of CO direct exposure can differ greatly from individual to person depending on age, overall health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
