<p>There are some varieties of mold that contain hazardous compounds (mycotoxins). However, exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible for the most part, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the released spores. The primary risk of mold growth, as it relates to indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More severe than many allergenic properties is the ability of mold to activate episodes face to faces that currently have asthma, a serious respiratory illness.<p>
<p>During regular furnace operation, dust, dirt, moisture from humidity or condensation, and microbial developments can build up on internal components. Airborne aspects from regular household products and surface areas can result in formicary rust within your HVAC equipment. Left unattended, these concerns can lead to loss of effectiveness and worse, breakdown of component products and a much shorter furnace life expectancy Over time, essential elements like the heat exchanger, burners or blower housing can start rusting, leading to minimized performance.<p>
