<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not use automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
