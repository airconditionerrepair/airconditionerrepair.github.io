<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either since of visible growth or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
