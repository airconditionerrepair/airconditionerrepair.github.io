<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same pollutants. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>For example, pollutants may gather within the air diffusers and grills, presenting pollutants into the environment. Or if the outside air consumption is located near a source of wetness or other outside contaminant, it may work as a path to carry the contaminants inside. Or the ventilation system may not be working as well as it needs to-- if debris is blocking the outdoor air consumption, for instance, or the filters are contaminated or improperly maintained.<p>

<p>Particular kinds of HVAC units are a little more expensive than wall systems, ceiling or cassette units are nicely hidden inside the ceiling in the classroom and are therefore more discreet and visually pleasing to look at.
