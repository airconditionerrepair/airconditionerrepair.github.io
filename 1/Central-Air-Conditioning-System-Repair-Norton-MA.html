<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it might suck up to two times the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would use.

Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than devices installed simply a few years earlier.<p>

<p>Geographically, some locations pay regularly greater salaries for air conditioning tradespersons. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable climate, or simply a high level of competitors for skilled trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's greatest typical earnings for HVAC professionals at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 each year. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.
