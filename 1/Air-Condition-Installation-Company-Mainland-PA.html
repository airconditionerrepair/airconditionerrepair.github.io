Stale indoor air and heating systems can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing allergen, family pet dander, and mold spores distributing through your house. In late winter and early spring, it may still be too cold to toss open the windows to take out the moldy air, so while you await the warmer weather condition it is necessary to be familiar with a few of the allergic reaction and respiratory triggers that may be hiding in your surroundings.<p>
