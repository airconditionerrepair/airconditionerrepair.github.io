<p>Furnaces as they age risk of developing fractures in the heat exchanger inside your furnace. Carbon monoxide gas, if present, could leakage into your house unnoticed. Indications of this may be frequent headaches, a burning feeling in nose or eyes, queasiness, disorientation, flu-like symptoms.

Cracks in the heat exchanger can take place undetected which is why nobody advises waiting up until they occur. The furnace needs to be changed immediately if your household is possibly being exposed to carbon monoxide.<p>

This makes geothermal heating a trusted and available source of energy.<p>
