Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it.
