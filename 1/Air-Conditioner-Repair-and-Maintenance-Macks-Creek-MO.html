<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Macks Creek MO?</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were extremely delighted that someone as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to test the a/c unit before you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to evaluate AC units even in winter season. We want we had understood him then.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
