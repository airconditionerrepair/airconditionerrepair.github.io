<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the issue.

The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
