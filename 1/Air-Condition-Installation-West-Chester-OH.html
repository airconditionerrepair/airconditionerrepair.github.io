<p>All houses require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from usage. Another possible reason might be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the appropriate temperature level. Heaters that kick on frequently might be because of an unclean filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a dirty burner.<p>
