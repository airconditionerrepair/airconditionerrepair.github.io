<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Integrity Energy fasted to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two furnaces were not working. They showed up the next day and replaced 2 furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the brand-new furnaces can heat the house. Honestly, our home heating unit is made complex, Rob and his team fixed the old duct work, altered all the dampers, make the entire system work completely.<p>
