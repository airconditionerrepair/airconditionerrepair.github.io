In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite considerable.<p>

When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
