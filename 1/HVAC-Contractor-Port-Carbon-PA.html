<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned routinely, they can become clogged with debris that can limit air flow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's effectiveness.

By contrast, checking and changing a furnace filter can usually be carried out in just a couple of minutes, frequently without any tools needed.

<p>If your a/c is more than 8 years old, repair is most likely not worth the expenditure, unless it's a simple issue like particles clogging the condenser system or a used fan belt.

Improving those components may increase the efficiency of the system as much or more than setting up brand-new machinery.<p>
<p>In a packaged central air conditioner, the condenser, evaporator, and compressor are all located in one cabinet, which typically is placed on a roofing or on a concrete slab beside your home's structure.

Packaged air conditioners often consist of electric heating coils or a natural gas furnace. This mix of a/c and central heating system gets rid of the need for a different furnace inside.<p>
