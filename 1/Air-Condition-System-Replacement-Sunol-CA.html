<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<h3>Water Boiler Repair in Sunol CA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
