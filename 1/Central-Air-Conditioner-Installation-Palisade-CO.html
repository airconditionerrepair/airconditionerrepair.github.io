<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you should examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
