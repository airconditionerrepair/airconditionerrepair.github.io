<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 ought to be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to provide sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A typical aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
