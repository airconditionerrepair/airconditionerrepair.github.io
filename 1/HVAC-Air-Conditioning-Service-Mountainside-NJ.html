<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>The cost for heat pump installation also depends upon the size of the unit and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house units, on the other hand, variety in cost from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heatpump typically need excavation to install, which adds numerous thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
<p>The early few years of your organisation are an interesting time, and it's appealing to let pure interest direct your course forward.
