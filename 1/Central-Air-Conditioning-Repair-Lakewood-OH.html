<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then determine the height and width of the opening. Be sure to have those measurements on hand when purchasing an air conditioning system to guarantee it'll fit comfortably into the window.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution.

When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to provide enough modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A common element required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
