Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that protect your a/c system from flooding. Among the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you may have a water leak in the attic. The water triggers your emergency security switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
