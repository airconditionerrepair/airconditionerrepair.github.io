<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Add To Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can likewise exacerbate indoor air quality issues. The HVAC system may be polluted (because of mold in duct lining or bacteria on coil or filters, for example), and the system may spread out these pollutants throughout the home. Second, the HVAC duct circulation system can spread out contaminants from one portion of the house to another. Routine maintenance and duct sealing can help lessen these problems.<p>
