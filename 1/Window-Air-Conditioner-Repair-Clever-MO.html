For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to try to find a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winters. The good news is that the one major downside of heatpump is that they can stop working in the incredibly hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
