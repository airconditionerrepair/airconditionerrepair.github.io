<p>I am replacing our High Speed System because of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have a choice for an extra $2,818.00 to set up a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>A 3rd method to choose whether your home may have bad indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, look for signs of problems with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can show your house may not have sufficient ventilation consist of moisture condensation on windows or walls, foul-smelling or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other products end up being musty. To identify smells in your house, step outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your house, note whether smells are noticeable.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might select to change the outside compressor with a modern, high-efficiency unit. Consult a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the new compressor is correctly matched to the indoor unit if you do so. Nevertheless, considering recent changes in refrigerants and air conditioning styles, it might be wiser to change the whole system.<p>
