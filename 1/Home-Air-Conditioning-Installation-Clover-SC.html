<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning system back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s beneath package to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>
<p>If you work in building, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator repair shop or lead factory, or your hobby includes lead, you may unconsciously bring lead into your house on your hands or clothing. You may also be tracking in lead from soil around your house. Soil really near to homes might be polluted from lead paint on the exterior of the structure. Soil by highways and roadways might be infected from years of exhaust fumes from cars and trucks and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to clean your feet before getting in the house. If you deal with lead in your job or a pastime, alter your clothing before you go house and wash these clothes independently. Motivate your children to play in sand and grassy locations instead of dirt which stays with toys and fingers. Try to keep your kids from eating dirt, and ensure they clean their hands when they come inside.<p>
