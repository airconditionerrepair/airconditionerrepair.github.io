<p>The Work Environment tab includes the number of jobs kept in the occupation and describes the workplace, the level of exercise expected, and normal hours worked.

(Even something as apparently harmless as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
