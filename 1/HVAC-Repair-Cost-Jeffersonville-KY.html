<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
