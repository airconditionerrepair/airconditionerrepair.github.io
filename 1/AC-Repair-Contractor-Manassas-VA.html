<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. The probability of instant responses to indoor air toxins depends on numerous factors including age and preexisting medical conditions.

Some people can become sensitized to chemical or biological pollutants after repeated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor system as near your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech showed up right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the visit. They recommended replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost however a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was very happy they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will certainly be utilizing them again.<p>
