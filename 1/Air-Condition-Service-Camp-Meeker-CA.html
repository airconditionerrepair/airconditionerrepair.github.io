<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
