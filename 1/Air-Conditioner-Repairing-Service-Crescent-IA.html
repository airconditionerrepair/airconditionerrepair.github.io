<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, class or lab environments, rather than industrial or outside settings. In jobs where union subscription is not a problem, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather costly if you are including on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
