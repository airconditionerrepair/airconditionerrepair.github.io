<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
