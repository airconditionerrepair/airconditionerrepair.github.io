<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew simply what the problem was and fixed it very rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
