<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
