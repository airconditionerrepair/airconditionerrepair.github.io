It might also include the installation of signs up where the ductwork connects to specific spaces.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
