<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Leaky return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>The compressor can shut and overheat down if the condenser coils are clogged. You'll experience intermittent durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling.

Then tug the disconnect block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Image 2). If the a/c service still doesn't work properly after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC won't work totally unless you do this.<p>
