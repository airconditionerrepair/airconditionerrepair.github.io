<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in monthly, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me concerning an abnormally high bill that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had called the service manager and left a message of concern. Ron had found the difficulty area in looking over the costs. He fixed the issue in one day, had actually changed the costs to what I thought about fair prior to he recalled, understood what might have triggered the problem and had a strategy to insure that it would not take place again. I have actually thought about All Points a company with stability for the nine years we have actually used them. This experience verifies that.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ might discover unpleasant or moldy odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are becoming worse, speak with your doctor about them. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for excellent structure management.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung out troubleshooting the issue, all the while discussing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
