<h3>Assessing Commercial Boilers to Residential Boilers at Sims NC</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electrical power open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
