<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor system as near your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Prior to setting up any brand-new heating or cooling system in a house, it is needed to re assess and lower the energy load of the home. A more energy efficient house will not just decrease the cost of a brand-new system and utility expenses, but it will considerably enhance the comfort of your house. Before we style and install any systems, we set up a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will suggest improvements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these enhancements. Basic enhancements generally include adding insulation and air sealing steps. Energy Environmental Corporation deals with and can recommend numerous certified home Energy Star auditors and installation professionals. Please Contact Us for references.<p>

Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to reduce the amount of emissions.
