<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that might impact the health of people who live in the home. Toxins could come from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon getting in the house from the ground below. An air toxin might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or personal care products. Germs and viruses, family pet dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Filters can get unclean quickly, particularly if you live in an area that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all type of dust, particles, germs, and clean the air.

She didn't need a air filtration system, however they talked her into it.<p>
