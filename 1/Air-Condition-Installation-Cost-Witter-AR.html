<p>Today's house convected heat systems take full advantage of infrared radiation. Without a doubt, the most typical source of a radiator in a home is the flooring mass.

<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment).

In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
