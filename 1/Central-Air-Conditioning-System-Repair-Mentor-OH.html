<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many furnaces have numerous control boards. The biggest, or only one in some heaters, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control panel should be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t properly detected, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when set up. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a professional to detect.<p>

For example, people breathe out carbon dioxide, which in little quantities is not harmful, but might end up being dangerous if high concentrations are permitted to build up.

If micro-organisms do develop, they might spread throughout the whole work environment or building by means of the ventilation system.<p>
