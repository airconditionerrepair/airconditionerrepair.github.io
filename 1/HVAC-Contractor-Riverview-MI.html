<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be extreme. They include delays in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Babies, children, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead exposure than grownups because lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more conscious the destructive results of lead. Kids may have higher direct exposures since they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
<h3>Vertical Air Conditioner in Riverview Michigan</h3>
<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and place of toxin exposure. An example of time control is arranging floor waxing and removing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>The predominant health impact connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your danger of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
