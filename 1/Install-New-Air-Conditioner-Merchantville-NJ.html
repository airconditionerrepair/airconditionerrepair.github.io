<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Essential Business in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% performance or much better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which may be rated as low as 80% efficiency, this can mean significant savings in yearly heating expenses.

<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heatpump, everything needs to be changed ultimately. As equipment ages, it ends up being less efficient.
