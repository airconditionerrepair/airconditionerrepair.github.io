He solved the issue in one day, had adjusted the costs to what I considered reasonable before he recalled, understood what may have caused the problem and had a strategy to insure that it would not occur once again.

<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ might observe musty or undesirable smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are becoming worse, speak to your doctor about them. But not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
