<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
