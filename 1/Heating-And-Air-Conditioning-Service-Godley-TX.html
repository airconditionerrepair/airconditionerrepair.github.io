<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
