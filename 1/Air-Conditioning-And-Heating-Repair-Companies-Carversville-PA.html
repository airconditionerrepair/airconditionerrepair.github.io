<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO protect the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor sensibly, a number of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales strategies that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a trusted company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products include vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. When they are handled in a way that creates dust containing asbestos fibers which can be inhaled, these items provide a threat just. When asbestos-containing materials are harmed or disturbed by repair, remodeling, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can end up being airborne if correct controls are not in location. This can result in the potential for substantial illness.<p>
