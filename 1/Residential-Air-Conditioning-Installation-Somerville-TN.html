<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
