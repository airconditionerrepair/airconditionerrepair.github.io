All of the latest heating systems are a lot more energy-efficient than those installed even 20 years ago.

If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, despite the fact that it was six months prior to the existing one expired. She didn't require a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
