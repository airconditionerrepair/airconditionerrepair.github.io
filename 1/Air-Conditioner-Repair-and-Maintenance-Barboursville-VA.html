<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the like geothermal energy though, and the 2 need to not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC take advantage of the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water supply, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is used for producing power in the form of electrical energy. The two operations utilize different processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to achieve its objectives.<p>
