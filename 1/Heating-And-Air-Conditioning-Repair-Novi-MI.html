<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank.

<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the exact same. When the wiring is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately treat and harden-- normally two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
