<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not provide auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in on a monthly basis, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
