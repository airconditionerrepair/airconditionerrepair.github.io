<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals emitted as gases from procedures or products; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by individuals and animals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. It can become air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>
