Secondly, if you prepare to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, ensure that an effective wetness barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
