<p>While radon in water is not an issue in houses served by the majority of public water materials, it has actually been discovered in well water. If you've checked the air in your home and discovered a radon issue, and you have a well, get in touch with a laboratory certified to determine radiation in water to have your water tested. Radon issues in water can be readily fixed. Call your state radon workplace or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more information.<p>
<p>A/c can also be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
