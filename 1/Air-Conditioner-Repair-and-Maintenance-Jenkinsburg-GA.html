<p>An undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it has to run longer than a properly sized unit. Since it merely takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit, an oversize compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In reality, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
