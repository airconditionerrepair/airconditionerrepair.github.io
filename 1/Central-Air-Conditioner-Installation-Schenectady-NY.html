<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
