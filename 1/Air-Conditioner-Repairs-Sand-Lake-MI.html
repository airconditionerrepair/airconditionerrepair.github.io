<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a hard job that the workers sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps guys working. When a sales male comes to your house he is there to offer, that is the only way he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and should not "need" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I offer you the options for your requirements and you choose if you need it.<p>

<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with badly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from inside and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
