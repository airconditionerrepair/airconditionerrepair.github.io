<p>We're Not Just Another Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Disease (BRI) describes less frequent (however typically more serious) cases of individuals becoming ill after remaining in a specific building at a particular time. In these cases, there is normally a similar set of scientific symptoms experienced by the people and a clear cause can often be found upon investigation. Legionnaires Illness is an example of BRI brought on by germs which can infect a building's cooling system.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Image 6).<p>

<p>New a/c typically range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER rating means higher energy efficiency and potentially lower energy expenses. A great SEER rating for you depends on your house size, where you live and other elements. Even the minimally permitted SEER ranking is going to be far more energy efficient than your existing, old a/c. It's not constantly about selecting the model with the highest SEER score, it's discovering the one that's right for you. This is where your dealer can assist.<p>
<p>When our furnace was dying, we called 2 local companies for bids. While both were informative and useful, Ballard Gas offered us a better deal, for exceptional service. Rather than a simple sales task, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heater and located methods we might have more even heat. He consisted of these small but significant changes in his quote. Since of recent warmer summers and for environmental factors, we decided to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
<p>You could upgrade to the highest efficiency equipment available and still not feel easily cool on hot days. That's because the mechanicals are just part of the central air conditioning system. The average home's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before deciding whether to repair or change your condenser and blower systems, your technician needs to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring how much air gets away the system.<p>
