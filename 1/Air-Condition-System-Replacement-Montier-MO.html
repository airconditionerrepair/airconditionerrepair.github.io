An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is lowered, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather considerable.<p>
