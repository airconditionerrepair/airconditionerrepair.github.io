<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same.

Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
