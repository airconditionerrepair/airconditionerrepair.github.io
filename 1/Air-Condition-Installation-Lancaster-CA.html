<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- give All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work extremely well in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Operating on electrical energy, a heatpump is a cost-effective solution utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, however in reverse. Instead of warming or cooling the air currently inside your home, it draws heat or cool from the air exterior and presses it through the ventilation system of your house.<p>
<p>For example, problems emerge when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to generate appropriate amounts of outdoor air. Insufficient ventilation also takes place if the air supply and return vents within each room are obstructed or placed in such a method that outdoor air does not really reach the breathing zone of structure residents. Poorly situated outside air intake vents can likewise generate air infected with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading biological contaminants that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, ac system, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>

We chose to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump since of recent warmer summer seasons and for ecological reasons.<p>
<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company used 98% of the existing material purchased with the house. This company presented a service agreement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and pipes.
