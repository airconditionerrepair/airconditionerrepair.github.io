<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
