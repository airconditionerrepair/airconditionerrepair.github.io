<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or laboratory environments, instead of outdoor or commercial settings. In jobs where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
