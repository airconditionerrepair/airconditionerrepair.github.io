<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
