<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were going out.

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise controling the temperature level of the floor.

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 need to be adjusted frequently, and outside measurements used for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be necessary.<p>
