In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged.
