<p>Make sure there are no carpets, furnishings, or anything else restricting the circulation of air. Not just will blocked vents and signs up affect your comfort, they can likewise cause duct leaks due to excessive atmospheric pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns.

<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that moisture has to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply asking for mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a reliable and simple method to decrease ambient air pollution and possible health dangers, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Irritants are materials that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products.
