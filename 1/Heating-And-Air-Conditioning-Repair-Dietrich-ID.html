<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your a/c is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leakages, merely adding refrigerant is not a service. An experienced technician should repair any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the proper amount of refrigerant. Keep in mind that the performance and performance of your air conditioner is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the manufacturer's specification, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be damaging to the environment.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air conditioning unit is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's a/c are more energy effective than designs made even 5 years back, so it makes monetary sense to change or upgrade your system if it's 5 years of ages or older. The very best central air conditioning conditioner you can purchase today will utilize 30-50% less energy than one purchased in 1975 while providing the very same quantity of cooling.<p>

Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is really heated, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
