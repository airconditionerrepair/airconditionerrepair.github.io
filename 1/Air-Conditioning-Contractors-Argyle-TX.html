<p>Iâ $ m really picky with my things. I like my equipment and devices initial, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with inexpensive knock-offs. So buying this a/c unit to replace my old one was somewhat of a tough fact. You canâ $ t trust the commercial nowadays. Am thankful I got this though since it has actually restored my faith in good manufacturing. I havenâ $ t had a problem with this brand-new Carrier I got because I bought it 7 months back. Itâ $ s just ideal.<p>
<p>My eldest boy always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it actually didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else except replacing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
