This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
