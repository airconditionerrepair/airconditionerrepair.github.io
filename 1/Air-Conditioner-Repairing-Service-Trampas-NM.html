<h3>Furnace Repair Companies in Trampas New Mexico</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

Using central vacuum systems that are vented to the outdoors or vacuums with high effectiveness filters may also be of assistance.<p>

As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.
