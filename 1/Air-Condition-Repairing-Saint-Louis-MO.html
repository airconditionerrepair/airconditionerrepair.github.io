<h3>Assessing Commercial Boilers into Residential Boilers at Saint Louis MO</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heater. We selected getting something more costly than a standard water heater as gas is among our biggest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
