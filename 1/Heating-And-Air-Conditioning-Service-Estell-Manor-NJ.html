Depending upon the type of unit set up, it can be loud and cause problems if you're extremely allergic to dust.

During usage, there is a time delay while heat is being carried from the heating unit to the living space.<p>

<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
