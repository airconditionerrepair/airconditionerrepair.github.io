<p>Specialist heating unit setups. However, even the best-maintained heating unit will eventually fail. HVAC specialists recommend following this standard guideline when choosing whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a new system, it's finest to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up routinely, they can become blocked with particles that can limit air flow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's effectiveness.

By comparison, inspecting and replacing a furnace filter can usually be done in simply a couple of minutes, often with no tools needed. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
