<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
