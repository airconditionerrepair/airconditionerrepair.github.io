Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
