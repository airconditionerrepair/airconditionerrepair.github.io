<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do not accept them up until they have actually been effectively dried. If products with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
