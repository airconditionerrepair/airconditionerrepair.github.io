<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the same toxins. Simply put, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your house still heats to the right temperature. The temperature of the air produced by the heat pump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel very hot. Just be concerned if your home is not warming up. However, if your system does not seem working properly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you ought to hire a specialist to repair the unit and check.<p>

<p>Legionella is a parasite of protozoans such as amoeba, and therefore requires conditions ideal for both organisms. The bacterium forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, including chlorine. Removal for Legionella break outs in commercial buildings differ, but typically consist of very warm water flushes (160 ° F; 70 ° C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and in some cases flushes of heavy metal salts. Preventive procedures include changing normal hot water levels to permit 120 ° F( 50 ° C )at the tap, evaluating center design layout, getting rid of faucet aerators, and periodic screening in suspect locations.<p>

<p>Though it might be difficult to think, the air inside your house can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are infamous for lowering the air quality in your home, however there are many other pollutants that can not only unclean up the air, but lead to other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and structure materials add to poor air quality, and can likewise cause cancers. VOCs (volatile natural substances) from paint and even from some sort of carpets and upholstery materials can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit pollutants.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
