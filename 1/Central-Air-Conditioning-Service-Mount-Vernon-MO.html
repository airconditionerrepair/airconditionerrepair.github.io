<p>These people have actually been excellent. At a realtor, I in some cases require contractors to give me an opinion for what work on a house may cost. Just recently I required to contact these people two times. They came out quickly and provided me a no nonsense price quote for the work.

Integrity isn't simply their name, its a company model they take seriously. You guys are officially on speed dial. Talk to you soon.<p>
<p>2. Keep a healthy level of humidity. Dust mites and mold love moisture. Keeping humidity around 30% -50% helps keep them and other allergens under control.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.. Secondly like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to correctly service and the system has been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years.
