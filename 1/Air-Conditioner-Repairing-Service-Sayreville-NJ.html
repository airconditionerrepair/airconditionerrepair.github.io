<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the very same. As soon as the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly solidify and cure-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
