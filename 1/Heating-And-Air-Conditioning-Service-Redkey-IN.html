<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the exact same. When the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly solidify and treat-- usually two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
