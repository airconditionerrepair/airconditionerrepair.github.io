As a society, we ensure that our houses are well-sealed and well-insulated, but we do not believe enough about direct exposure to all the important things we put in our homes," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and structures has a huge effect on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea-- immediately, they can begin years after direct exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
