<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit increase. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
