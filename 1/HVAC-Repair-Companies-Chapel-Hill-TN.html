<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. Therefore, an expert service person need to be called for almost any maintenance besides routine cleaning. Central air conditioners must be expertly examined and changed prior to the start of every cooling season. Nevertheless, do not let your maintenance end with this yearly examination. While there aren't many repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system running at peak performance.<p>
