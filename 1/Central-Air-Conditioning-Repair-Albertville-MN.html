<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
