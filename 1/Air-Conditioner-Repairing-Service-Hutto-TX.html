<p>I have been using them for years for my companies, my own homes and my property customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. He assisted me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again. He is honest, dependable, and reasonable on price. It's tough to discover a sincere AC person and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO preserve the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor sensibly, many of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a reliable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is typically important to identifying the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such details can sometimes be obtained by requesting copies of air tracking data from the company. If keeping an eye on information is not offered, yet a high variety of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent ought to ask for that the employer have air tracking tests carried out. Evaluation of this information might identify potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are very low, keeping track of data might not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
