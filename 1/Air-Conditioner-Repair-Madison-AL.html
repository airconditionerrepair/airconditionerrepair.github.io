It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio where the system sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little more for that assurance.<p>
