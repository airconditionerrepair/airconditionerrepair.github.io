<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Convected heat systems have been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floorings and tied them into a hot water supply.

<p>Reality: Federal and local rewards typically amount to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the initial price of a system competitive with standard equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capability, throughout new building (houses typically utilize between one and 5 lots). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. Nevertheless, brand-new installation practices are decreasing expenses, to the point where the cost is getting closer to conventional systems under the right conditions.<p>
