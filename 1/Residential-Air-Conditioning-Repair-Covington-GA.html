<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, but it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same.

The outcomes can be rather significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

Because a system is set up in each space or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
