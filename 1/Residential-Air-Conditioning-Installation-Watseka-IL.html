<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. Therefore, a professional service person must be required almost any maintenance besides routine cleaning. Central air conditioners should be professionally examined and changed prior to the beginning of every cooling season. However, do not let your maintenance end with this annual examination.

<p>I have been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company.

<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Watseka IL</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between a outside and indoor unit rather of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>

<p>Next, and possibly just as important when it comes to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, however will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to effectively cool the house on hot days. Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should look out for. First, you must check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
