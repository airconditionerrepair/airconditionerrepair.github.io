<p>A specific a/c unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic ac system because both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the same air path. Because its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. However, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat is removed. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is actually heated up, just as by an electric heater that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
