<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals released as gases from products or processes; for the a lot of part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.
