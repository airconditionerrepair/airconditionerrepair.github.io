<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, workplaces and houses matters, particularly because we spend the majority of our lives indoors. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in incredibly damp environments or in cases where the ac system is extra-large, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the ac system will require more energy to cool your home. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
