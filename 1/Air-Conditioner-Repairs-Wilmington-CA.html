<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most budget-friendly. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
