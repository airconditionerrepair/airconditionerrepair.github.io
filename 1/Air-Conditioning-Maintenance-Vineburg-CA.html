<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO preserve the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'trustworthy' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a trusted company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems.
