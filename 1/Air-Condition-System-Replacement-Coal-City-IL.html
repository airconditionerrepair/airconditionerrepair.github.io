<h3>Vertical Air Conditioner in Coal City IL</h3>
<p>Dometic's commercial grade rooftop air conditioning system are performance-tested to overcome unusual or harsh road and climate condition. Many standard units break down after simply 4 hours of extreme vibration screening, while the Brisk II is still going strong at 30 hours and more! The galvanized steel top plate offers enduring strength while long copper lines lessen vibration and, therefore, sound too.

<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
