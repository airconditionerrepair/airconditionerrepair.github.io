<h3>Heat Pump Installation in Greenfield CA</h3>
<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
