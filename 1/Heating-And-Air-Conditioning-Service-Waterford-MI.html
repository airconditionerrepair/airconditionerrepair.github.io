<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.

Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide need to be calibrated often, and outside measurements used for calculations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>
