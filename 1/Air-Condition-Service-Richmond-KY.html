<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues in houses. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the house. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
