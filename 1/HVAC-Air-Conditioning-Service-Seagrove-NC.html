<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was very thorough and on-time in describing what services would be carried out. Also Camryn provided excellent customer service at the end of the visit by describing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few ideas of some maintenance jobs we might wish to have performed in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale methods utilized by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Nick B. provided exceptional, individualized, mindful, and quality service. His communication design is friendly, interesting and effective. He clearly and thoroughly discussed all issues and fixes in a way that made me confident in his capability to solve my repair problems. He followed through and went the extra mile to personally get a required part that was not in stock, guaranteeing repairs were made so that my other half and I would not have to sustain another night without heat, throughout one of the coldest winters in current memory. He also responded to my call instantly the next early morning, and coached me through a short-term repair to an issue that could not be dealt with on the first check out due to unavailable parts. I trust Nick's skills, experience and ability to provide constant, quality service.<p>
<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical material gradually. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
