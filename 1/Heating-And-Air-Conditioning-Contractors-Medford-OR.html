<p>. Prior to selecting the installation area of a/c unit, a number of main aspects need to be thought about.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you must examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
