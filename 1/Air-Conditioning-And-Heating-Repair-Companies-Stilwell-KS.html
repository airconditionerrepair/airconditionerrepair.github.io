Indoor air contamination studies have actually determined numerous pollutants that can be present in indoor air.

<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heating unit, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by distributing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space.

As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
