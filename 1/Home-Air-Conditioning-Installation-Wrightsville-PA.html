<h3>Heat Pump Repair in Wrightsville PA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
