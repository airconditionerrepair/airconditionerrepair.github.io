<p>Specific immediate results resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is typically tough to identify if the symptoms are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is essential to pay attention to the time and place symptoms happen.

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide need to be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>
