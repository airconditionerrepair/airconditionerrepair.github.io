<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Spencer NC?</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present trend in home building and construction is to minimize air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofs, floorings, and walls.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air waters down indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>

When we do any repair, the parts we use are backed up with a two-year parts warranty.
