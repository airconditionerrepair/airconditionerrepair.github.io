<p>The installation was quick, professional and very well done. The installers were polite and understood exactly what to do. I am an engineer by profession and recognize quickly individuals who are good at what they do.

I extremely extremely recommend the two gentlemen as they are exceptional at what they do. Thank you to them as they definitely deserve my thanks and appreciation for a task well done.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, but many use the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is most likely a much better service. If the current system has not incurred other significant repairs, is in otherwise outstanding condition, and problems that led to the breakdown can be recognized and treated, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense as well.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The objective is to provide adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A common element required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
