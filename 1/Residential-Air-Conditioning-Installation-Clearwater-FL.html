<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. Connection concerns along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the efficiency of the system. Loose, defective or missing wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and disrupt service.

<p>Warm weather is an indication that spring is well in progress which summer season, the hottest season of the year, will be here before you know it.
