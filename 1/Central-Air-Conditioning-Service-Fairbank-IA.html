<p>Aspects that can contribute to the development of biological impurities are wet or damp structure materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and poorly preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioning system. "Humidifier fever" is a typical disease caused by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs.

During operation, these contaminants can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the structure occupants. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are family pets and home plants.<p>
<p>Both must be kept tidy due to the fact that an air conditioner moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise necessary to frequently clean the condenser coil.
