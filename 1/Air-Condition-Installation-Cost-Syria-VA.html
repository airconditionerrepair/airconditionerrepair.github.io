<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Have to Know Before Buying in Syria VA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act much like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. A ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective if your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge toxins.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
