<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the standard water heater can be shut off totally.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single see, or you can sign up for a maintenance plan with your local heating and air conditioning company.
