<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a reference later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor.
