<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance in Barberton OH</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me concerning an unusually high costs that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had called the service manager and left a message of concern.
