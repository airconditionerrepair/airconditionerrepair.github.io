<h3>Get Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in The Rock GA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, determined particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Because an air conditioning unit moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept clean. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
