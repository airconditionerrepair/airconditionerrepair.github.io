<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must momentarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
