<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Hazardous direct exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is improperly eliminated from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in houses can also result from lead dust from outside sources, including polluted soil tracked inside, and use of lead in particular indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>Outside pollutants. Outside particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a home. Particulates and allergens discovered in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates. Experts recommend using filters with a MERV 6-8, but higher MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and typically are better suited for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
