<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a routine oil change in your cars and truck. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star advises replacing your filter once every three months. Throughout high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>

<p>In homes, the most substantial sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pushed wood products made using adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood items made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furniture); wood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiber board contains a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood product and is generally recognized as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood item.<p>

<p>Sometimes a short-term indoor air quality problem is created just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded meeting location. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's required, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more complicated concerns-- identified by consistently inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will require a different tack. Depending on the problem you're experiencing, one of the three methods listed below might be suitable.<p>
