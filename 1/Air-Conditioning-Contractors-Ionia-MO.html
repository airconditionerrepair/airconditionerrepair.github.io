<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your home will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
