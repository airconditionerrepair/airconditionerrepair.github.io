<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
