<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
