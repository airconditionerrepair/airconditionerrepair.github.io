<p>The toxins listed in this guide have been shown to trigger the health effects pointed out.

In a lot of cases, our understanding of the toxins and their health effects is too limited to determine the levels at which the listed results might take place.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ may discover undesirable or moldy smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not going away or are becoming worse, talk to your doctor about them. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for excellent structure management.<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the problem, all the while explaining everything to me.

After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
