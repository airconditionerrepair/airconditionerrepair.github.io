<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location. All objects in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the convected heat system has been operating for a while, including individuals. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace kicks in which abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off.<p>

So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>

Either way, if you want to keep your furnace heating for years to come, do not forget to keep it serviced and preserved frequently.<p>
