<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce pollutants.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
