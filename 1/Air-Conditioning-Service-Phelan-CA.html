<p>All houses require efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from usage.

If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem.

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
