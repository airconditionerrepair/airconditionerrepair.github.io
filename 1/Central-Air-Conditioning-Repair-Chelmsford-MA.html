<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, as opposed to outdoor or industrial settings. In jobs where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It might likewise consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to private areas.<p>

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it could suck up to two times the electrical power that even a low-end new one would use.

Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER.

Natural ventilation plans can utilize very little energy, however care needs to be taken to guarantee convenience. In damp or warm environments, preserving thermal convenience solely by means of natural ventilation may not be possible. A/c systems are used, either as backups or supplements.
