Also, tidy ducts and proper air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the essential equipment for the task. The bottom line?

<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your house's square video. They use a series of calculations based upon the British Thermal Units or BTUs needed to heat the area.

While an area heating system remains in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit lies to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
