<h3>Boiler Cleaning Service in Green Creek NJ</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for several years for my organisations, my own homes and my real estate clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again, he assisted me trouble shoot the issue. He is truthful, dependable, and affordable on price. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC man and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service contract attempts to upsell you every time they come to carry out regular maintenance?
