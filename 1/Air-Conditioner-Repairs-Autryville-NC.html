<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
