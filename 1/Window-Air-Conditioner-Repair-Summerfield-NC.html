<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>The most typical type of house heating system in the U.S. burns natural gas or propane to produce heat. With an average cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least pricey option, but newer systems can be really energy effective. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems normally achieve a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, highly effective gas heating systems can attain AFUE ratings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Depending on where in the United States your home is located, the local area's climate can alter drastically. A house situated in the South would require an AC unit with a size capable of cooling your house due to high temperature Summers. A house in the Northern part of the United States would need a much bigger heating capacity as well which will impact costs. See the chart listed below for the typical central air conditioning conditioner replacement expenses by HEAPS.<p>
