<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
