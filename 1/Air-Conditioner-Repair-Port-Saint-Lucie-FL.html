According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the very same contaminants. To put it simply, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
