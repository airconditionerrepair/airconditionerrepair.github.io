<p>Geothermal heatpump, along with all other types of heat pumps, have efficiencies rated according to their coefficient of efficiency, or POLICE OFFICER. It's a scientific way of figuring out how much energy the system moves versus just how much it uses. Most geothermal heat pump systems have Polices of 3.0 to 5.0. This implies for every system of energy used to power the system, three to five systems are supplied as heat.<p>

<p>Similar to many home improvement jobs, the cost of a complete central heater can differ widely based upon the size of the house. Many furnaces will last between 15 and 20 years. In choosing a furnace, homeowner ought to think about heat output and efficiency. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the house. A little home, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too rapidly and shut off for too long, resulting in irregular temperature levels.<p>
