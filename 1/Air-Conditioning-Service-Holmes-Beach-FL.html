<h3>The Way to Soundproof a Central Heating System in Holmes Beach FL</h3>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
