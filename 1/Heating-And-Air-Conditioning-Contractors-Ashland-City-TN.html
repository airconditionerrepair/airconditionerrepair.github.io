<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we advise utilizing our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money when used in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile rather of enabling heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>

The more residents there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have a negative impact on residents-- outside air needs to be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
