<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, however it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
