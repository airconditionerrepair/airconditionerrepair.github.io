<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the higher temperatures sometimes utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to offer thermal convenience inside. However, high humidity outdoors creates the requirement for mindful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities generate mold development and moisture indoors is connected with a higher occurrence of resident respiratory issues.<p>
<p>Reinstall the access panel and disconnect block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait for the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Startup," below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan must spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins however the fan doesn't. Shut off the power and get rid of the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and get rid of the fan blade and motor (Image 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan begins. , if it doesn't, you've provided it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>

After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
