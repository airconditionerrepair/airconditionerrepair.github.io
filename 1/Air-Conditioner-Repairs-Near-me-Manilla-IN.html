The average summer season temperature to arrive at the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to reach the appropriate SEER rating for your location, deduct 2 points for every 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER score needs to be at least 13 for all brand-new cooling systems made in the United States.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temps of 95 Â° F and an indoor temperature of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
