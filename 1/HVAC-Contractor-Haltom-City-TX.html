<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as important as a routine oil change in your cars and truck. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter once every three months. During high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
