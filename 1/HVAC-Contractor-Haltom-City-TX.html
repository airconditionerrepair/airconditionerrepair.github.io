A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter once every three months. During high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
