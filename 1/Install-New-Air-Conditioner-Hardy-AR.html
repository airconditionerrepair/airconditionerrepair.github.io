<h3>Choosing Commercial HVAC Repair Services in Hardy AR</h3>
<p>Everyone face a range of dangers to our health as we set about our daily lives. Driving in cars and trucks, flying in airplanes, engaging in leisure activities, and being exposed to toxic wastes all present differing degrees of threat. Some risks are merely inescapable. Some we pick to accept because to do otherwise would restrict our ability to lead our lives the method we desire. And some are risks we might decide to avoid if we had the chance to make informed options. Indoor air contamination is one risk that you can do something about.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
