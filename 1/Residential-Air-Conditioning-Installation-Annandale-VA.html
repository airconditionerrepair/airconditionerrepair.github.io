<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ might discover undesirable or musty odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to excellent structure management.<p>
<p>As mentioned above, activating your new under tile flooring heating unit too soon, before the mortar has treated, can trigger the grout to break or to not adhere effectively, and may void the service warranty of your mortar product. In some testing, even the tile split when the system was run before the substance had actually cured. And mortar producers may refuse warranty coverage if you do not follow their directions.<p>
