Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the room temperature level, and after that change it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
