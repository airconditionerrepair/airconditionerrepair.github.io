<p>The world's leading all-in-one software application for commercial and residential HVAC companies. HVAC specialists undergo a variety of potentially hazardous conditions. Technicians are frequently required to work in cramped locations, on high ladders near ceilings, or on the roofs of homes. They can be exposed to undesirable weather for extended periods of time.

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems.

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material over time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements.
