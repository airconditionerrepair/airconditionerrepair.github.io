<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service agreement tries to upsell you every time they pertain to perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, despite the fact that it was six months before the current one expired. She didn't require a air purification system, however they talked her into it.<p>
