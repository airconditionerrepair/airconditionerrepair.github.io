<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being airborne.
