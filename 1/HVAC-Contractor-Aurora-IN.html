<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>It is especially essential to take as many of these steps as possible while you are involved in short-term activities that can create high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint stripping, heating with kerosene heating units, cooking, or participating in maintenance and hobby activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding. You may also pick to do a few of these activities outdoors, if you can and if weather permits.<p>
