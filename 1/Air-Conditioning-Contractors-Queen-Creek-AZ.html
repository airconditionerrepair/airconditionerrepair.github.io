The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller house, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other elements that can impact this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>

That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance check outs annually, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and usually some other advantages. Some companies provide priority consultations to their maintenance plan members.<p>

The team took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater. We selected getting something more pricey than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy costs.
