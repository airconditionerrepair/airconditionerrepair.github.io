<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>
