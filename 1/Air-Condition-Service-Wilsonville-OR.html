<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house.

Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfy. Other aspects that can impact this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>

<p>At present, EPA does not advise utilizing air cleaners to lower levels of radon and its decay items. The efficiency of these devices is uncertain since they just partly eliminate the radon decay items and do not lessen the amount of radon going into the home. EPA prepares to do extra research on whether air cleaners are, or might end up being, a trustworthy methods of reducing the health danger from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, offers more details on air-cleaning gadgets to lower indoor air pollutants.<p>

According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
