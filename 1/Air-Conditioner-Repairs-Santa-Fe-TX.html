<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise given that 1978. The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their overall power should not go beyond the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, nevertheless, it is really common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, because the total capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outside system. Basically, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not basic, because it considers not only the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

<p>I have been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a difficult job that the employees sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps people working. When a sales guy pertains to your house he is there to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and must not "require" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I give you the options for your requirements and you choose if you need it.<p>
