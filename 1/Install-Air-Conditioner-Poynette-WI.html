<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Important Service in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are ranked 90% performance or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which might be rated as low as 80% efficiency, this can imply significant cost savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern two- and three-stage heating systems increase performance even further by running at lower or greater capability depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Underfloor heating is easy to set up, particularly if you make it part of a construct or restoration project. For instance, Warmup's StickyMat option can be installed as a Do It Yourself job as it is basic to lay down with the electric wire being all pre-spaced and easily connected to the mesh, ready to be rolled out in place. Plus, there's even an included cleaning benefit as keeping the rooms dust-free is much easier without the nooks and crannies of radiators.<p>
