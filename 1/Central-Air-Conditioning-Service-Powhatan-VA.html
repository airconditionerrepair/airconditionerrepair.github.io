<h3>Signs It's Time to Replace Your Boiler in Powhatan VA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
