<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceedingly uncommon now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>Whatever heating unit you set up, it's necessary that it's sized properly for your home. Too big and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should. Plus, it will use excessive energy for the amount of heat you want produced. If the system is too little, then your house won't be warmed properly and the system will need to constantly run to attempt to heat the entire home, which will increase heating costs.<p>
<p>You might update to the greatest efficiency equipment offered and still not feel easily cool on hot days. That's since the mechanicals are just part of the central air system. The typical home's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Prior to deciding whether to repair or change your condenser and blower units, your technician needs to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining how much air leaves the system.<p>
