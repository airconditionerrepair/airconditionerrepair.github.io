<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
