If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut off completely.<p>
