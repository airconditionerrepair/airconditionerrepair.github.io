<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
