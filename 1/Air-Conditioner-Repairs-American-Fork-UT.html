<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't give off heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen gradually because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to work till you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside ought to be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
