Although temperature levels are often in the comfort variety, some professional procedures, such as open heart surgery, require low temperature levels (about 18 ° C, 64 ° F) and others, such as neonatal, relatively high temperatures (about 28 ° C, 82 ° F). In both convenience and procedure applications, the objective might be to not just control temperature, but also humidity, air quality, and air motion from space to area.<p>
