<p>The possibility of immediate reactions to indoor air toxins depends upon several factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 crucial influences. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a toxin depends upon individual level of sensitivity, which differs significantly from person to person. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological toxins after repeated exposures, and it appears that some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical contaminants too.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off toxins.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
