<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your home will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<h3>Advantages of Allergic Your Central Heating Boiler in Wilmer AL</h3>
<p>The rest of the HVAC system also needs to be in leading condition for the a/c unit to work well. This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which reside inside the home. The technician can examine the ductwork for signs of holes, gaps or extreme dirt if the specific parts are in appropriate order. Sealing leakages in ductwork can improve HVAC efficiency by as much as 30 percent, and provide for a cooler home in the hot summer.<p>
