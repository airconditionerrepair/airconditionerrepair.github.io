<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ might notice unpleasant or musty odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are becoming worse, speak with your doctor about them. However not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
