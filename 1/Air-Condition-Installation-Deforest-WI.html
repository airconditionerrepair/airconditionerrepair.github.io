<h3>Home Furnace in Deforest Wisconsin</h3>
<p>If your a/c unit is more than eight years old, repair is most likely not worth the expenditure, unless it's a basic problem like debris clogging the condenser unit or a used fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace choice, ask your contractor to evaluate not simply the condition of your existing equipment, but likewise the ducts that provide the cool air and the overall quality of the insulation in your home.
