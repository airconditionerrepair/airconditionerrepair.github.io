<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance determine the effectiveness of dilution.
