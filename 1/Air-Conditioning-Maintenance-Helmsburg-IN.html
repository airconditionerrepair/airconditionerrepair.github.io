<p>There is no simple answer, but lots of use the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a better option. If the existing system has actually not incurred other major repairs, remains in otherwise outstanding condition, and problems that led to the breakdown can be identified and remedied, repairing the system can make a great deal of sense too.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
