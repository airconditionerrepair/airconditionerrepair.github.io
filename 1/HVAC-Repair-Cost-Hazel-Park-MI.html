<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
