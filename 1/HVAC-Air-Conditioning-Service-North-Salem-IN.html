<h3>What to Search for When Selecting an North Salem IN HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>One of the primary reasons a furnace will run continuously is due to the fact that something is filthy or stopped up Before attempting to repair any issue, take some time to make certain that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". Check the furnace blower for clogging and clean it if the air filter is great to go. Have a look at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it if this does not work. If you still can not find out why your furnace keeps running, contact a skilled technician.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
