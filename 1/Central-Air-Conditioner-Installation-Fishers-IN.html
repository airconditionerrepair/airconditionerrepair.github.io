<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more problems, because some of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each room. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>

<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a tough task that the employees sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps people working. When a sales male comes to your house he is there to offer, that is the only method he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and should not "need" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I provide you the choices for your requirements and you decide if you need it.<p>
