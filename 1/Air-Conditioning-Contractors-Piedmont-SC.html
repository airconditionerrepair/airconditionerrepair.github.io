What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very practical in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to temporarily handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
