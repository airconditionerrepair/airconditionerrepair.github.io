<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
