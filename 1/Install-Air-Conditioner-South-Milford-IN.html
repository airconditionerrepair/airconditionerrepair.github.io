Purchased a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
