<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Myerstown PA?</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very delighted that someone as knowledgeable as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to test the a/c unit prior to you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to test AC systems even in winter. We want we had known him then.<p>
<p>An undersize unit will not have the ability to cool spaces down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run because it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit. Since it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off prior to it has an opportunity to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>

<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI affirmed before the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor guidelines based on the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor appliances through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our new furnace and AC system. The best thing about G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Also they identified the issue and repaired very rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
