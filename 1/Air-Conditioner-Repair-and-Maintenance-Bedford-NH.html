<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my businesses, my own homes and my real estate clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with different prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the concern. He is truthful, reliable, and reasonable on cost. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC person and I'm happy I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO preserve the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor wisely, many of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a reliable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Changing your old furnace with a new, more effective model can fight volatile energy rates, reducing your heating costs by up to 45%. Advancements in heating innovation have led to systems that contaminate less, improve convenience, and last longer. A twenty to thirty year old furnace usually has an AFUE of about 65%. The lowest performance allowed by law for new gas designs is 78%, and there are numerous options that accomplish 98%, for near overall effectiveness.<p>
