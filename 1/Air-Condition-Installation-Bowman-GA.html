<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have actually been correctly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. If goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
<p>Air toxins can vary from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your animals to harmful gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a common air pollutant resulting from gas that escapes into your home without being burned off. Older homes might consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when released into the air. In kitchens and bathrooms, mold and mildew can end up being a problem where wetness levels are generally higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Over the previous couple of years, there has actually been some publicity suggesting that houseplants have been shown to minimize levels of some chemicals in lab experiments. There is currently no evidence, however, that a reasonable number of houseplants eliminate significant amounts of pollutants in homes and offices. Indoor houseplants should not be over-watered because overly wet soil might promote the growth of microorganisms which can affect allergic individuals.<p>
