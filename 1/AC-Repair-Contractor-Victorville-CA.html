<p>1. Central Air Source Heat Pumps Air source heatpump work best in a mild climate, where the temperature level doesn't get too expensive or too low. To put it simply, they are perfect for our Seattle climate! They are extremely efficient, beating out most other types of heating unit in performance. The only real exception to this would be a geothermal heatpump system. However, a geothermal installation usually costs tens of thousands more than an air source heat pump, which typically indicates it stops working in terms of return on investment.<p>

<p>Before you head out and purchase an a/c unit, there are a couple of things to decide initially. Where are you going to be installing the a/c unit? If your home is not equipped with ductwork, do you wish to install some or go ductless? How large should the air conditioning system be? Too big and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can harm the a/c unit and reduce its life. Too little and your a/c will not have the ability to cool the house properly. When going shopping for a new AC system, these are simply a few of the aspects that you need to take into account. Each option can and will substantially impact your system's efficiency, which is why you can't manage to neglect any of them.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off pollutants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you must inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
