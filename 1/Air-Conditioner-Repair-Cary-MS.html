<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment producer's to ensure your factory guarantees stay in place. In addition, the tangible results of a PM is typically tough to measure, as one action mentioned the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. The majority of pieces of a furnace or ac system do not simply break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the result of recurring use of an element that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature degeneration, resulting in cracks and holes. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the element.  a very advantageous result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
