<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ may notice undesirable or moldy odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for excellent structure management.<p>
