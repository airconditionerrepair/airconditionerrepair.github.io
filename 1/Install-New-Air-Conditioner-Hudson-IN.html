No proof exists suggesting that in-floor heating either favorably or adversely impacts home values. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the yearly Cost vs. Value Report provided by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Improvement Magazine.

<p>Unstable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals discharged as gases from items or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might consist of volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within during water use.<p>
