<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
