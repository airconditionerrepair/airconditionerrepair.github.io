<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. Often it's not a major problem, and your system might simply require some maintenance work. It is unexpected how many people practice preventive maintenance on our automobiles, for instance, however do not do the same thing for the system that keeps us warm in the winter.

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
