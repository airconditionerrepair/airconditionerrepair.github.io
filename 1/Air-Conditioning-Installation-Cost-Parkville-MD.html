<h3>Recognizing the Significance of HVAC Systems in Parkville MD</h3>
<p>And it's not just downtown high- and mid-rise apartment or condos bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually viewed the single-family home installation business completely turn on its head the last few years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to approximately three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not just with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle house owners are finally giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Lots of factors impact IAQ. These factors include poor ventilation (lack of outdoors air), problems controlling temperature, low or high humidity, recent remodeling, and other activities in or near a building that can affect the fresh air entering the structure. Sometimes, specific impurities like dust from building or restoration, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (including percentages of chemicals launched as a gas over time) may trigger bad IAQ.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
