Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be turned off totally.<p>

The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
