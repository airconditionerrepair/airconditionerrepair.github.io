<p>Lead has long been recognized as a damaging environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " primary ecological risk to the health of children in the United States." There are numerous ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, weakening paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Prior to it was understood how harmful lead might be, it was used in paint, gas, water pipes, and many other products.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was very helpful in gathering details on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to temporarily deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and used clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and home.<p>
