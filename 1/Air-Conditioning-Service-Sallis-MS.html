<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the see. They advised changing a few parts that were going out.

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in cars in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12.

<p>The predominant health impact connected with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
