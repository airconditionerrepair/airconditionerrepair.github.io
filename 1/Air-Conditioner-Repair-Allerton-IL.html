<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
