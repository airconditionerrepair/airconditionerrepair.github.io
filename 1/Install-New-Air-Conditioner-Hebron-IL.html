<h3>Home Air Conditioning Company in Hebron IL</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my services, my own houses and my realty clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again. He is truthful, dependable, and reasonable on price. It's hard to find a truthful AC man and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
