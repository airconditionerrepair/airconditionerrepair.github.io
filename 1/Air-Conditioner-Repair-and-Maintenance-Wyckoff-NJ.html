You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>

An air pollutant could also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, previously owned smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care products.
