<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not use automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money can be found in on a monthly basis, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
