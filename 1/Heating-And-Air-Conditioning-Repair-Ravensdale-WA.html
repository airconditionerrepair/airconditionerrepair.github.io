Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, many of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Apartment or condos can have the same indoor air issues as single-family homes due to the fact that a number of the contamination sources, such as the interior structure materials, furnishings, and household items, are similar.
