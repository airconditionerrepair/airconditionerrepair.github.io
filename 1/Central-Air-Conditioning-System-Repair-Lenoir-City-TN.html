<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the very same. Once the wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately harden and treat-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might select to replace the outside compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency system. Consult a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the new compressor is appropriately matched to the indoor system if you do so.
