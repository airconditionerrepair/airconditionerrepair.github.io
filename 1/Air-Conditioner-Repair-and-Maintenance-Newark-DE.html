<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

The main external system can be linked to a number of different indoor types: floor, ceiling, cassette, etc<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heater seems less like a luxury product and more like a requirement. (Besides, warmed floorings were excellent enough for the Roman Empire) But before you dedicate to what can be a major renovation task, it's best to ask yourself whether a radiant floor heating unit is an appropriate option for your specific home heating needs.<p>
