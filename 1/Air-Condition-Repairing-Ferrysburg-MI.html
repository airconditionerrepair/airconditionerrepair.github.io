<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Things HVAC Repairin Ferrysburg MI</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating system. We picked getting something more pricey than a standard water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility expenses. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
