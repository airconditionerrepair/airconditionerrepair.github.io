I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
