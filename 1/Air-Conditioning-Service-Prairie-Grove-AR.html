During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
