Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
