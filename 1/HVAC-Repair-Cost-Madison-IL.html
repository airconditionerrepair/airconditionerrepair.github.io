<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating units are still widely utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>A bioaerosol is an air-borne product of a biological pollutant. Biological contaminants in the home may include mold, bacteria, infections, mites, and pollen.

They also can cause allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma. Symptoms caused by biological pollutants consist of sneezing, eye irritation, coughing, lightheadedness, and respiratory infections.<p>

<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens found in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can become airborne, and therefore, are quickly breathed in. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks.

<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical product in time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
