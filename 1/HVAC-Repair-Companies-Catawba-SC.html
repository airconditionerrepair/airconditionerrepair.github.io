<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Maintenance in Catawba SC</h3>

Temperature level levels need to vary from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30% and 60%.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol result, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which may get in neighboring ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
