The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the house.<p>
