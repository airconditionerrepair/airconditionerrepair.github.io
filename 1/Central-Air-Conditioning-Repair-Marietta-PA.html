<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. For that reason, a professional service individual ought to be called for almost any maintenance aside from regular cleaning. Central air conditioning conditioners should be professionally inspected and adjusted prior to the beginning of every cooling season. Nevertheless, don't let your maintenance end with this yearly checkup. While there aren't many repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance treatments you can follow to keep your system operating at peak effectiveness.<p>

This implies that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
