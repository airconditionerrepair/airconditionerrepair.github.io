<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump can be quickly integrated with existing systems such as standard forced air or glowing floor heating or can be installed in a new building.

Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heatpump installation and can assist you properly size a system.<p>
