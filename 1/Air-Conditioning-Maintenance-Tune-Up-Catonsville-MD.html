<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the traditional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the standard water heater can be shut off completely.<p>
<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, because some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
