<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
