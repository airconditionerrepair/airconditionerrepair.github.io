<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge pollutants.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
