Much like other types of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of performance (COP). COP rates how much heat a system removes or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling effect.

What this implies is that for every single system of energy utilized by a geothermal heat pump, roughly 3 to 5 units are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
