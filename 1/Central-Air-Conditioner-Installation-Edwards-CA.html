<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
