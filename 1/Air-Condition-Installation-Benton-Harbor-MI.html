<p>Considering that the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they make more effective. This was originally driven by increasing energy costs, and has actually more recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental issues.

Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks.
