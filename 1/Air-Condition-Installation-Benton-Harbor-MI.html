<p>Considering that the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they make more effective. This was originally driven by increasing energy costs, and has actually more recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental issues.

Irritants found in indoor air are primarily biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being airborne, and therefore, are easily breathed in. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can cause asthma attacks.

If that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the element.  an extremely advantageous outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
