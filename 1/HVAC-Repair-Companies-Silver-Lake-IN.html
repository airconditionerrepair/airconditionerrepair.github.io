Perhaps Realtors should think about a lot of variables to definitively mention what a radiant heat system may add to, or subtract from, any provided asking price. That stated, property buyers wanting to go green," who focus on energy savings, or who absolutely desire an in-floor heating system will want to pay a premium for a home that includes one.<p>
