<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
