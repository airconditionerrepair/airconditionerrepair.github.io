<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same. When the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly cure and solidify-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
