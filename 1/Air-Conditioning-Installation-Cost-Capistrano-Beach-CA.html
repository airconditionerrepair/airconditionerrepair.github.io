On those days when you simply can't seem to heat up and find you need to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can draw all the humidity out of your house and leave your sinuses pulsating. In-floor heating systems are not vulnerable to this concern because they heat surfaces and not the air itself. Additionally, given that they do not trust fans, ducts, returns and registers to disperse hot air, in-floor heating systems can minimize the quantity of dust and seasonal allergens in your house.<p>
