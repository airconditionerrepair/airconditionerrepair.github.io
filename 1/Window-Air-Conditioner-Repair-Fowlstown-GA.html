<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Fowlstown GA</h3>

<h3>Pool Heat Pump in Fowlstown GA</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
