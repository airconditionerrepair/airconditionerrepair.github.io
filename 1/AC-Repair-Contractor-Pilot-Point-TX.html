<p>To identify the appropriate size of oil furnace you need for your home, calculate the home's square footage and identify what zone your home remains in.

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide must be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be needed.<p>
