<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be extreme. They consist of hold-ups in physical and psychological advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Children, fetuses, and infants are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups given that lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more conscious the harmful impacts of lead. Children may have greater direct exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
