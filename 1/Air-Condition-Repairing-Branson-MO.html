<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the exact same. Once the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly treat and harden-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
