<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
