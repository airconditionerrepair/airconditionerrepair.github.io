<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a recommendation later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>

If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
