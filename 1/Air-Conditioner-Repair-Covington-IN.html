<h3>Air Conditioner Repairs Near me in Covington IN</h3>
<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
