<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based.

Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide ought to be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be needed.<p>
