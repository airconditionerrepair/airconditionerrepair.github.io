<p>There are numerous things to take into account when attempting to determine how frequently I should change my a/c filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 home has an unique DNA on how it builds up dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how often your a/c filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better right choice on how typically your HVAC filters require changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses.
