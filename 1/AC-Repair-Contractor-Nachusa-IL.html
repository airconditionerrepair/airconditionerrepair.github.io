<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most heaters have several control boards. The biggest, or just one in some heating systems, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control board should be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t properly detected, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable once set up. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>
