<p>All houses require effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the correct temperature level. Heating systems that kick on regularly may be due to a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>

It's time to call a professional if at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something seems unusual or you lose self-confidence. Likewise, if the process does not work, something else is wrong and you require a technician to examine the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you discover you have to do it frequently, it's most likely time for a professional viewpoint.<p>
