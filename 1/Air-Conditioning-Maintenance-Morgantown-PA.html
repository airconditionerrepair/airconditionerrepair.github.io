<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate since it merely takes more electrical power to run a larger unit. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a chance to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>
