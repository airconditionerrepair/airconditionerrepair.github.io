<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing pattern in home building and construction is to decrease air leak through fractures and other openings in roofings, floorings, and walls. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
