<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, however to have two significant elements fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by guarantee.
