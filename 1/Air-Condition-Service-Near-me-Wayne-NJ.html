<h3>Effective Tips for Furnace Cleaning in Wayne NJ</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though most air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems might be belt-driven. Screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler normally occur when the belt that links the motor to the blower slips. In many cases, the belt is incorrectly lined up or used and needs replacement. Follow the guidelines above under Air Conditioner Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>
