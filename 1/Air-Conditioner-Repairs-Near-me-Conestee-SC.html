<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- provide All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work effectively in temperate environments like King and South Snohomish counties. Operating on electricity, a heat pump is an economical solution utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, however in reverse. Rather of warming or cooling the air currently inside your home, it draws heat or cool from the air exterior and pushes it through the ventilation system of your house.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioners and fridges utilized combustible or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion home and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold.

Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
