<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not use auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
