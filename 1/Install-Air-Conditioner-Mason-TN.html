The circuit boards manage and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the new control panel need to be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t properly identified, altering a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable as soon as set up. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
