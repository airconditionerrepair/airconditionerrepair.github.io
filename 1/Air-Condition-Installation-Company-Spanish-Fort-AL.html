<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c unit works but your house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
