<p>. Before selecting the installation area of air conditioner, a number of main elements need to be thought about. Firstly, the direction of air flow from the indoor systems ought to not fall on the place of rest or work area. Secondly, there need to not be any obstacles on the way of the airflow that might avoid it from covering the area of the premises as much as possible. The outdoor unit should likewise be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from your house will not be successfully released outside and the productivity of the whole system will drop sharply.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle.

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, however it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a space or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have a negative influence on residents-- outside air should be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
