<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- give All Vovo a call! Heatpump work extremely well in temperate environments like King and South Snohomish counties. Running on electricity, a heat pump is an affordable option utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, but in reverse. Instead of warming or cooling the air already inside your house, it draws heat or cool from the air exterior and presses it through the ventilation system of your house.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can also exacerbate indoor air quality issues. The HVAC system may be contaminated (because of mold in duct lining or bacteria on coil or filters, for example), and the system might spread out these contaminants throughout the home. Second, the HVAC duct distribution system can spread out toxins from one part of the house to another. Routine maintenance and duct sealing can help minimize these issues.<p>

When getting an estimate, make sure to ask not just if a company is certified, but also what type of license it holds.<p>
