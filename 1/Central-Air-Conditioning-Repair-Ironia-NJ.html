<p>A/c can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
