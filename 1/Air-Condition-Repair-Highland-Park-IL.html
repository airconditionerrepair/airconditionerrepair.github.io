<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
