<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Brightwood OR</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most inexpensive. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
