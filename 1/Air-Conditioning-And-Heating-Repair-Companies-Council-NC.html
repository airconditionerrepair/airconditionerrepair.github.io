<h3>Central Air Conditioning Service in Council NC</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my organisations, my own homes and my realty clients' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. He helped me trouble shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again. He is honest, trusted, and affordable on cost. It's hard to find an honest AC guy and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

I trust Nick's abilities, experience and capability to provide constant, quality service.<p>
