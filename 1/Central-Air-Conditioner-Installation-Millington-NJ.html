Occupational direct exposure limitations noted in health and safety regulations and the Limit Limit Values ® (TLVs) suggested by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are planned as a guide to avoid disease or certain effects (like eye and nose irritation) in industrial scenarios. These limits may not be suitable in office settings or for the house.<p>
