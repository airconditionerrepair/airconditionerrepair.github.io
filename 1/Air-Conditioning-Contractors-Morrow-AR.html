<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ may notice unpleasant or musty odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are worsening, speak to your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
<p>In some cases a temporary indoor air quality problem is created just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded meeting location. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's needed, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more complex concerns-- recognized by regularly inappropriate air quality monitoring results-- will need a various tack. Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, one of the 3 tactics below may be suitable.<p>
