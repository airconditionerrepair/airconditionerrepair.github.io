<h3>The Way to Have the Best Gas Furnace For Your Home in Baldwin Park CA</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on various house efficiency upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest cost savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's items and services was remarkable. Taylor assisted us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to carry out the necessary electrical enhancements to save on cost.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
