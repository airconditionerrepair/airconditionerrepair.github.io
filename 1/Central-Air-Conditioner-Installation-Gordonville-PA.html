<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
