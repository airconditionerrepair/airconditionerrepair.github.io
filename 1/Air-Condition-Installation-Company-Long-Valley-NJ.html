<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to ten years old, it might flatter two times the electricity that even a low-end new one would use. That's due to the fact that it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to offer a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER.

<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the job based just on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of reasonable ones got. Others were almost two times the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex properly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up group was considerate of my home and installed the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post set up evaluation outcomes look very good for braising and plumbing quality.
