<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room.
