<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ may observe musty or unpleasant smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues.
