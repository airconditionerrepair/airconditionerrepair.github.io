<h3>HVAC Systems Are Essential for All Homes and Offices in Tamassee SC</h3>
<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) is an essential problem in correction facilities. It can straight affect the health and comfort of correctional officers and prisoners.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<h3>Heating System Repair in Tamassee SC</h3>
<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtering. From one of the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some standard maintenance.
