<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heating unit, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>

<p>Many commercial buildings use mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that are part of the heating and HVAC systems. Some structures can likewise use natural ventilation by opening windows or doors. The ventilation rate" is the quantity of outside air presented into an area per a system of time, and is frequently expressed in cubic feet per minute (cfm).

<p>We look at clues before we provide advice to replace instead of repair a heating system. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy costs are higher every year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective design, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older system.<p>
