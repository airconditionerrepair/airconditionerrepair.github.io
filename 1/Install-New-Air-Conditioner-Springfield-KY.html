<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
