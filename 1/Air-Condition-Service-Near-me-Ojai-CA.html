<p>Details offered in this safety guide is based on present clinical and technical understanding of the issues presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. The standards do not require you to alter your existing central air systems, and replacement parts and services should still be available for your house's systems. The "lifespan" of a central air conditioning conditioner is about 15 to twenty years. Manufacturers typically continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts available and honoring maintenance agreements after the brand-new standard goes into effect.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were preferred in the very first half of the 20th century, particularly in commercial structures, apartment and very large houses. Lots of steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago stay operable, since the lack of moving parts makes them less prone to wear and tear. A steam boiler replacement expenses between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>
