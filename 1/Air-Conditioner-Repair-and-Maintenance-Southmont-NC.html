<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning system works however the house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
