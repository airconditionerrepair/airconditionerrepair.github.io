<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is frequently crucial to identifying the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such information can in some cases be obtained by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If keeping track of data is not offered, yet a high variety of health signs have been reported, the Union agent must request that the employer have air monitoring tests performed.

However, when pollutant concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on data may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
