<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product with time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
