<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost great however Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
