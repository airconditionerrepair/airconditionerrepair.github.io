<h3>How Can Air Heat Pump Works in Hudson NH?</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix utilized in cars in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, however is still imported and can be purchased and used by certified HVAC service technicians. For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by lots of people.<p>
