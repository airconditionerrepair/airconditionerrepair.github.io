<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: They were fantastic! Numerous HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally requested. They met my needs completely by providing an expert quote with choices, without pressing extra products. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The likewise quickly followed up with the necessary examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
