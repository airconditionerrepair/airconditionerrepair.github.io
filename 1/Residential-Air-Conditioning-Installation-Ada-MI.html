<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside system as close to the house as possible per my demand.

<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the see. They suggested replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning.
