<p>All houses require effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been burnt out from use. Another possible reason might be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the appropriate temperature level. Heaters that kick on often may be due to a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>
