<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside system as near to your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)
