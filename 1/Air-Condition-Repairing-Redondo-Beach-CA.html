<p>The most dangerous asbestos fibers are too small to be noticeable. After they are breathed in, they can build up and remain in the lungs. Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be fatal). Symptoms of these illness do not show up until many years after exposure started. The majority of people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to raised concentrations on the job; some developed disease from exposure to clothes and equipment brought home from task websites.<p>

<p>On the other hand, you have 100% control over whom you employ to install your central air conditioning system. In fact, you can even Do It Yourself, regardless of our strong recommendation not to do so. If you do take our recommendation, expect to pay in between $300 and $1,000 in labor expenses to install central air. Moreover, cooling contractors might charge an additional $50 to $200 for extra supplies and devices.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a tube two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
