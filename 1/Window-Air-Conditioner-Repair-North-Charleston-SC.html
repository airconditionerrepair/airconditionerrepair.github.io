<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. Because as much as 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has a built-in effectiveness benefit. Since they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Due to the fact that an unit is set up in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>
