This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heat pump While room a/c supplies maximum versatility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is typically more pricey than central air.<p>
