<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat.

Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly treat and harden-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
