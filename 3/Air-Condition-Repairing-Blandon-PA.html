<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace in Blandon PA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating unit. We chose getting something more pricey than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy costs.

<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very practical in collecting details on the phone and providing clear directions about how to temporarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and offered clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
