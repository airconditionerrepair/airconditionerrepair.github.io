Stagnant indoor air and heating unit can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing allergen, pet dander, and mold spores flowing through your home.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, talk to your medical professional about them. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for great structure management.<p>

In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products consisting of carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, possibilities exist will be mold growing nearby. Fix the wetness issue, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely tidy the location using recognized health department suggestions.<p>
