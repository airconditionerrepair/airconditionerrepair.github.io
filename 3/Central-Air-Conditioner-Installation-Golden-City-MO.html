<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system rather of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was required and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the water heater since the specialists thought they just didn't seem ideal and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
