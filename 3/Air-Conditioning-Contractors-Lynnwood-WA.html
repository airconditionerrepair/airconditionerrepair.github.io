<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been stressed out from usage.

If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>

<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is generally higher than many heat pump options, they can still be extremely efficient, depending on the model you purchase.
