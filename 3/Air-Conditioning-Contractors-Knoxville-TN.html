<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>

Allergens discovered in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can end up being airborne, and therefore, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks.

<p>The primary health effect associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might position risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your risk of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
