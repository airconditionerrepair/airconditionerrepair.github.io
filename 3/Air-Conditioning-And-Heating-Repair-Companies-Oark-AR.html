<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered with a Oark AR HVAC Company</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Some sources, such as building materials, furnishings, and family items like air fresheners, release toxins more or less continually.
