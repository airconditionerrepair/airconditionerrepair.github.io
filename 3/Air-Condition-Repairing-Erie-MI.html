<p>This is especially notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the very same. When the circuitry is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively treat and harden-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
