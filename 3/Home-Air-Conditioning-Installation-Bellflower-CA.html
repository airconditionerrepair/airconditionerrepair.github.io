<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for consultation and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, much of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
