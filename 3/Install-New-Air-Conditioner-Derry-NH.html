<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
