<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance at Clayton CA</h3>
<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of replacing or exchanging air in any area to supply high indoor air quality which involves temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, smells, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates undesirable smells and excessive wetness, presents outdoors air, keeps interior building air distributing, and avoids stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
