<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have two different units (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the a/c into a heat pump While room cooling provides optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is usually more expensive than central air.<p>
