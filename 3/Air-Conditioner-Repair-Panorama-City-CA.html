<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
