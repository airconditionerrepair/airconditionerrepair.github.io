<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
