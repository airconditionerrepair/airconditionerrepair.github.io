<h3>The Operation of the Boiler Burner in Kings Mountain NC</h3>
<p>If you require furnace operate in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they needed to purchase it. My spouse stated that she had seen a fantastic evaluation for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good people I have actually satisfied in a very long time. If we want to have alternatives to ACME heating, we need to support the real people who are there for us. Please do.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't use them.. Secondly like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to effectively service and the system has been running issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
