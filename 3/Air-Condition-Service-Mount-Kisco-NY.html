<h3>AC Duct Replacement in Mount Kisco NY</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
