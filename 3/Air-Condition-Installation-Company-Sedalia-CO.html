<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, but to have 2 major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>When our furnace was passing away, we got in touch with two local companies for bids. While both were handy and helpful, Ballard Gas provided us a much better deal, for remarkable service.

He consisted of these small however significant changes in his bid.
