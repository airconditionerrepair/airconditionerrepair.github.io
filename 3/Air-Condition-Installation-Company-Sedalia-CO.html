<h3>HVAC Service Technician in Sedalia Colorado</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, but to have 2 major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>When our furnace was passing away, we got in touch with two local companies for bids. While both were handy and helpful, Ballard Gas provided us a much better deal, for remarkable service.

He consisted of these small however significant changes in his bid. Due to the fact that of recent warmer summertimes and for ecological factors, we decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
