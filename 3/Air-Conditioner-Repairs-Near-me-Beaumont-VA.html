<h3>Gas Boiler Repair in Beaumont Virginia</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, however to have 2 major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Whatever heating unit you set up, it's essential that it's sized correctly for your home. Too big and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should.
