<h3>Benefits of Purchasing on Gas Furnaces in Ephrata PA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his inspection, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging long trenches or deep holes to install the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end.
