We decided on getting something more pricey than a conventional water heater as gas is among our greatest utility expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>

Never ever utilize a gas range to heat your house. Always make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in use.<p>
