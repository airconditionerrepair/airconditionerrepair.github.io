<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost excellent however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>

Adoption of these innovations, nevertheless, has not been extensive, as consumers remain mainly oblivious to the effects of air quality on health and performance.<p>
