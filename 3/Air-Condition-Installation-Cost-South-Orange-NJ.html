Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
