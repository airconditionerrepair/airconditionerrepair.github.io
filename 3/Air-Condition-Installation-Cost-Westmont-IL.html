<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system parts, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
