However, select your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a reliable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by individuals and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
