<p>A main factor in the prevention of health symptoms is an effective, correctly developed and running ventilation system.

So, ensure to choose based upon how frequently you will use your heating system, the load that will be placed on it and the frequency with which you plan on having it serviced each year. For many temperate environments with low heating loads in the winter, having a super high rated heater is not always essential.<p>
