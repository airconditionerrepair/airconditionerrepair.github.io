<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity expert at a large retailer who asked not to be called because he did not have consent to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a group that regularly keeps an eye on energy consumption and temperatures in shops to minimize expenses (especially in the evening) and to alert store managers if temperature levels in the stores fluctuate beyond an appropriate range that could avoid customers from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>Think about a whole house dehumidifier if your single stage air conditioner isn't old sufficient to justify replacement. By setting up dehumidification devices inside an existing single phase system, you can delight in some of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without replacing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, enhancing indoor air quality and allowing higher convenience at higher temperatures.<p>
