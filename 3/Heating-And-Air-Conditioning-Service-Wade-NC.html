<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely valuable in gathering details on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to momentarily handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and offered clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and house.<p>
<p>If the AC does not shut off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't produce heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen in time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to do the trick up until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
