While toxins typically found in indoor air can cause lots of harmful impacts, there is considerable unpredictability about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are essential to produce specific health issue. People also respond really differently to exposure to indoor air contaminants.

<p>For example, issues develop when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to bring in adequate amounts of outside air. Inadequate ventilation also occurs if the air supply and return vents within each room are obstructed or put in such a way that outside air does not really reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Poorly located outside air consumption vents can also bring in air polluted with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms.
