<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material over time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
