<p>Recent Review: They were fantastic! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially asked for. They met my requirements entirely by providing an expert quote with alternatives, without pushing extra products. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The likewise immediately followed up with the necessary inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung out troubleshooting the problem, all the while describing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working properly. He needed to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
