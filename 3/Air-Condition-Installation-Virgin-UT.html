<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Building And Construction and Commissioning is developed for architects, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other professionals concerned with indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home include building products, smoking cigarettes, household items, and making use of unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas ranges or kerosene area heating units.

<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists if no impurity sources are discovered. Excessive re-circulation of air results in "stagnant air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. When ventilation is not sufficient to account for a boost in the number of employees in the area, stagnant air might likewise be an issue.<p>
<p>Whatever heating system you install, it's important that it's sized correctly for your home. Too big and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should. Plus, it will use too much energy for the quantity of heat you desire produced. If the system is too small, then your house won't be warmed adequately and the system will need to constantly run to try to heat the whole house, which will increase heating bills.<p>
<p>There are several non-profit companies that accredit indoor air quality experts. Although DEP can not suggest the services of any particular individual or company, choosing an expert that has gotten the appropriate training and accreditation must help guarantee you get quality services. When selecting an indoor air quality professional, it is necessary to compare the services (and costs) of various professionals, inspect recommendations, etc. simply as you would for any other services or product.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
