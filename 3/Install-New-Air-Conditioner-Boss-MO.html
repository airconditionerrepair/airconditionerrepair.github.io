<h3>HVAC Supply in Boss Missouri</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>

<p>HVAC coils generally give you an excellent 15-20 years of life before they begin developing refrigerant leakages. Refrigerant leakages aren't the only problem a/c coils have.

<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
