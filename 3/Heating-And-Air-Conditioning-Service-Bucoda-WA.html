<p>Sean was very useful. He is a very pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>

<p>HVAC is a fundamental part of residential structures such as single family houses, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living centers, medium to big commercial and office buildings such as high-rise buildings and healthcare facilities, automobiles such as vehicles, trains, submarines, ships and aircrafts, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are controlled with respect to temperature level and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>The predominant health effect connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
