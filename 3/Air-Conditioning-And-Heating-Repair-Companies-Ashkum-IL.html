What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about options.
