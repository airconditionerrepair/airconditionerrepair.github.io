<h3>Air Duct Cleaning in Eldridge Missouri</h3>
<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and location of contaminant exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor removing and waxing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday. This permits products to off-gas over the weekend while most of the personnel are at house over the weekend. Location control includes moving the contaminant source away from occupants and even relocating susceptible residents.<p>

<h3>Air Conditioning Service in Eldridge MO</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for years for my businesses, my own houses and my real estate customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. When I called and he advised me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the issue. He is truthful, trustworthy, and sensible on cost. It's hard to discover an honest AC guy and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
