<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>

Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
