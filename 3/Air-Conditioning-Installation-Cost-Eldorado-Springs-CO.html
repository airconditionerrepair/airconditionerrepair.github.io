<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very helpful in gathering info on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to momentarily handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and offered clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your house that best temperature throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those typical air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to pricey repairs down the road. So, be sure to alter your AC filters frequently, or get an a/c service plan which typically consists of a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
