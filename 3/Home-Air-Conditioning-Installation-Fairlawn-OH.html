<p>A hydronic glowing floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipes installed under the floor or right within the flooring surface itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the flooring mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and people. It does not depend on heating or moving air to move heat.<p>
