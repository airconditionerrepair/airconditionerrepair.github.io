<p>Since an air conditioner moves heat between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept tidy. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
