Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in extremely damp environments or in cases where the ac system is oversized, it might not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioner will need more energy to cool your home.

Transmitting heat through strong objects will also trigger it to last longer than using air as a thermal medium.
