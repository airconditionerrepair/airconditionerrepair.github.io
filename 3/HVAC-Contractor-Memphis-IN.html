<p>Because they get rid of wetness from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a generally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To deal with condensate issues, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>

<p>These men have actually been excellent. At a real estate agent, I sometimes require contractors to give me an opinion for what work on a house may cost. Just recently I required to call on these men two times. They came out quickly and offered me a no nonsense estimate for the work. Even when it was news my client probably wouldn't want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the honesty. Integrity isn't just their name, it's an organisation design they take seriously. You guys are officially on speed dial. Speak to you soon.<p>
<p>Typically the most effective method to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the quantity of emissions.

Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later in this area.<p>
