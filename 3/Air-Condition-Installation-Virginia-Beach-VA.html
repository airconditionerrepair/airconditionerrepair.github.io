The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep.

They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they had to purchase it. My other half stated that she had actually seen a fantastic evaluation for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most good people I have met in a very long time. We need to support the genuine individuals who are there for us if we want to have alternatives to ACME heating.
