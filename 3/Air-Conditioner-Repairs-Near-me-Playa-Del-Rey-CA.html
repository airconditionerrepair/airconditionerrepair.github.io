<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside system as close to your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
