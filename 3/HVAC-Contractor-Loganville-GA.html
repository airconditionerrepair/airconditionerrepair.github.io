<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
