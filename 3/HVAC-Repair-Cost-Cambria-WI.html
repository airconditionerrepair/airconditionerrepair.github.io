<p>The most common kind of home heater in the U.S. burns natural gas or gas to produce heat. With an average cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least expensive choice, but more recent systems can be very energy effective.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The goal is to supply adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A common element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
