<p>To secure family members with asthma or to reduce the possibility that someone in the house might develop asthma, the house must be checked for potential indoor asthma activates. Each room in the house has prospective asthma activates. Some issues can be fixed quickly, but others may need more time and work to control or get rid of asthma triggers. Easy-to-fix problems, such as chemical odors and scents, add to indoor air contamination and have been known to asthma symptoms in sensitive individuals. Other sources of indoor air contamination might be harder to discover. For example, using room deodorizers may mask the odor of mold. It will improve the indoor air quality if the source of moldy smells can be discovered and gotten rid of.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ may see unpleasant or moldy smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>

And nearly 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
