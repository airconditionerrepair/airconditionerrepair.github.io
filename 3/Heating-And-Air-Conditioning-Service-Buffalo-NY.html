<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
