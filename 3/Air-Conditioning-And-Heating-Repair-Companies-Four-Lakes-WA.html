<h3>Significance Of HVAC And Its Role in Four Lakes WA</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are exceptionally effective, because ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is always at a constant temperature level. These systems can obtain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just achieve an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of performance (COP). COP rates just how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling impact. Most ground source heatpump have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this indicates is that for each system of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, approximately 3 to 5 units are provided back in the kind of heat.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years back and know the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running.
