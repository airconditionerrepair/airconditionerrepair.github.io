Many typical structure products utilized prior to 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Normally, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the building products are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure renovation.
