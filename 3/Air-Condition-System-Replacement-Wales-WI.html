<p>All Points Heating provides home a/c, a/c unit installation, a/c maintenance that provide reliable, tested efficiency at high performance. Combustion items from auto exhaust, heating systems, hot water heater, area heating units, aromatic candle lights, oil lights, wood ranges, fireplaces, and gas ranges that are not properly vented can create carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion products may lead to throat, eye, and nose inflammation; tiredness; dizziness; and nausea.<p>
<p>A/c unit manufacturers generally make rugged, high quality items. Start by examining any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner fails. Let the system cool down for about 5 minutes prior to resetting any breakers.
