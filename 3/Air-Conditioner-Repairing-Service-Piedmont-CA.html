<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, rather than commercial or outside settings. In tasks where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the building. It might also consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to specific areas.<p>
<p>Apartment or condos can have the same indoor air problems as single-family houses because a number of the pollution sources, such as the interior structure products, home furnishings, and home items, are similar.
