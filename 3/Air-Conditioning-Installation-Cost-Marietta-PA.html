<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>

However, some manufacturers require routine maintenance as a regard to the warranty.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service agreement attempts to upsell you each time they concern perform regular maintenance?
