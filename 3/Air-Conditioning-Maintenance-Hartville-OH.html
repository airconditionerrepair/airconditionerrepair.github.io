The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future.

These aspects consist of poor ventilation (absence of outdoors air), issues managing temperature, high or low humidity, recent remodeling, and other activities in or near a structure that can impact the fresh air entering into the structure. Sometimes, particular impurities like dust from construction or remodelling, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (consisting of small amounts of chemicals launched as a gas over time) might cause bad IAQ.<p>
