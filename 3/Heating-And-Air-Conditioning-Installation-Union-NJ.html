<h3>Heating Systems in Union NJ</h3>
<p>We provide superior heating and cooling service and repair in addition to HVAC system repair, maintenance, and duct cleaning company. For over 25 years, Ballard Gas Service has supplied the highest quality services for your home. You can take comfort in understanding that we will treat your a/c unit, furnace, hot water heater, ducts, or gas fireplace the exact same way we would treat our own-- with the best care and highest quality professionalism.<p>
<p>This is especially noteworthy, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with badly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more difficult to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, but it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing expensive-- which can have a negative effect on occupants-- outside air must be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
