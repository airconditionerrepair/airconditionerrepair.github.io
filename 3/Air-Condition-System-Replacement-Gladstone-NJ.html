<p>A specific air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioning unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the very same air path. Due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space.

Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is actually heated up, just as by an electric heating system that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
