<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roof, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for house owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems contain not only the air conditioning system itself however likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is certainly the cost.

Nevertheless, one con is that these units are generally just offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capability.
