<p>I have actually been using them for years for my services, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with different prices and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He assisted me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, trusted, and sensible on cost. It's tough to find an honest AC man and I'm grateful I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>

But more complex concerns-- identified by regularly unacceptable air quality tracking results-- will need a various tack.
