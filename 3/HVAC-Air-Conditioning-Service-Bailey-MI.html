<h3>The Function of the Boiler Burner in Bailey MI</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the math lately, however I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and want to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>Oil heaters tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which needs to be appropriately vented and cleaned up from the furnace routinely. Change the filters periodically and have your ductwork cleaned since the soot develops inside the ducts, lowering their performance over time. Expect to service your furnace yearly at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running optimally.<p>
