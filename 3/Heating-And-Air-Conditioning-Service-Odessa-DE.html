<p>The most typical kind of home heating system in the U.S. burns gas or propane to produce heat. With an average cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least pricey alternative, however newer systems can be very energy effective.

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
