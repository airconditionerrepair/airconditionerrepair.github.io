<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a large central air conditioner unit that sits outside your house. Heat pumps run on electrical energy and work like air conditioners in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC unit is wintry.
