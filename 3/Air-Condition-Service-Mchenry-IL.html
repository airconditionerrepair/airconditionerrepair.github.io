<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
