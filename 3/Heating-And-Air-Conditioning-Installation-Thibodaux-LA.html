<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the a/c into a heat pump While room cooling supplies maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is normally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
