<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
