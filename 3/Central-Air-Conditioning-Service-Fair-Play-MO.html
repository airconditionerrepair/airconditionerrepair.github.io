(If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
