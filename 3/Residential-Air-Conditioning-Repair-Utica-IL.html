<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more problems, given that a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each space. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
