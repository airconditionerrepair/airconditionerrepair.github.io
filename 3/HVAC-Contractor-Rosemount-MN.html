<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
