<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that might affect the health of individuals who reside in the home. Pollutants might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon going into your home from the ground listed below. An air toxin could also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, unstable organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or individual care items. Bacteria and viruses, family pet dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine parts. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
