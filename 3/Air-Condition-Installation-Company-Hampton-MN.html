<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut off completely.<p>

The bacterium forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, including chlorine. Remediation for Legionella break outs in commercial buildings vary, but often include very warm water flushes (160 ° F; 70 ° C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and sometimes flushes of heavy metal salts. Preventive measures consist of adjusting typical hot water levels to allow for 120 ° F( 50 ° C )at the tap, evaluating facility design layout, removing faucet aerators, and regular testing in suspect areas.<p>
