<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Dripping return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
