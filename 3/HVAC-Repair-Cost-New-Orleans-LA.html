Of course, too-dry air can also aggravate your sinuses and lungs, while excessive indoor humidity can contribute to the development of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Our specialists are trained, experienced and licensed to set up, preserve and repair commercial and residential air, ventilation and heating conditioning devices and to tidy and inspect your chimney or ventilation shaft.

The building type consisted of both commercial and residential. Most of samples examined were checked favorable for bacteria and fungi.<p>
