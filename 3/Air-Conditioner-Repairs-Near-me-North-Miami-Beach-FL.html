<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be extreme. They consist of delays in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, infants, and children are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults since lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the harmful impacts of lead. Children may have greater exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at North Miami Beach FL</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating system. We decided on getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our biggest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Numerous aspects affect IAQ. These factors include poor ventilation (absence of outside air), problems managing temperature, high or low humidity, recent improvement, and other activities in or near a structure that can impact the fresh air entering the building.
