<p>Filters can get filthy easily, specifically if you reside in a location that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all type of dust, debris, bacteria, and clean the air. They're responsible for keeping the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will eventually stop performing as you anticipate it to if they're not cleaned and replaced frequently.

<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material over time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
