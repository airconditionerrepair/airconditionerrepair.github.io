They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioner".

When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
