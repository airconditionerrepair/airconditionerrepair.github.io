<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate modification affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern ac system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit boost. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
