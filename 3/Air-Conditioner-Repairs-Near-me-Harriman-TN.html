<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Problems in Harriman TN</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
