These systems can achieve a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only achieve a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other types of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE OFFICER rates how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling result. A lot of ground source heat pumps have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for each system of energy utilized by a geothermal heat pump, around 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the form of heat.<p>
<p>Installation involves digging long trenches or deep holes to install the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. Nevertheless, you'll save cash over the long term since of the lower energy costs. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as conventional air-source systems.
