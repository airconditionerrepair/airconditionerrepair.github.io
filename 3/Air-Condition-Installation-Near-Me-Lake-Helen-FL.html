Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the traditional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be turned off completely.<p>

Counting on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a home can be heated up in cooler months by transferring and condensing energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels discovered simply a couple of feet below ground. In the summertime, the process reverses, thus cooling a home by getting rid of heat. Underground temperature stays constant no matter the environment, so geothermal systems supply reliable and consistent heating & cooling.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, implying they use air to exchange heat, in the exact same way as an automobile radiator or normal household air conditioning unit does.

My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
