<p>Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is updated every four years. The Basics Handbook consists of heating and cooling estimations. The design expert must seek advice from ASHRAE data for the standards of style and care as the normal building regulations provide little to no information on HVAC style practices; codes such as the UMC and IMC do include much detail on installation requirements, however. Other useful referral materials consist of products from SMACNA, ACGIH, and technical trade journals.<p>
<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to save energy.

Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to offer thermal comfort inside your home. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities give rise to mold growth and wetness inside your home is associated with a higher occurrence of resident respiratory issues.<p>
