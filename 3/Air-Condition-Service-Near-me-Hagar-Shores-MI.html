<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Many reliable HVAC service technicians will offer totally free estimates with an in-person service call. Beware of HVAC contractors who try to offer you a totally free quote over the phone, as it may not precisely show what they will find when they check out the system.

<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may choose to replace the outdoor compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency unit. If you do so, consult a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the brand-new compressor is appropriately matched to the indoor unit. Nevertheless, considering current modifications in refrigerants and air conditioning designs, it might be better to replace the whole system.<p>
