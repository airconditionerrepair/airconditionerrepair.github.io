<h3>HVAC Repair in Benton Mississippi</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, but to have two major components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Due to the fact that HVAC service technicians require to be physically present to do their work, they have not traditionally offered virtual or remote services.
