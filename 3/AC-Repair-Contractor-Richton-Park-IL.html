<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, instead of commercial or outdoor settings. In jobs where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It might also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to private areas.<p>
