<p>We're Not Just Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to watch out for is the dust that collects during summertimes. The best thing to do is ensuring that the heating system burners are examined and cleaned thoroughly prior to cooler seasons begin.

Perhaps it is time to begin believing about purchasing a new one if your furnace is in a very poor condition.<p>
<p>More typical in relatively older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes electrical energy, oil or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in private rooms. All-electric boilers can achieve as much as 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers must accomplish 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers need to attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
