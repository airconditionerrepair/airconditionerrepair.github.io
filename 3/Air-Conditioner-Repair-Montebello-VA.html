<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, providing warm air to individual bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
