Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature, and after that change it ON. To prevent straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
