<p>Indoor air pollution is caused by burning strong fuel sources - such as firewood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. The job of an HVAC technician is relatively complicated and can vary substantially from one home or office to the next. Every maintenance task and repair is various from the last. Every maintenance job might require completely different steps and procedures than the previous, depending upon the age and condition of the system being examined. Installations can also differ substantially, depending upon the age of the structure and how well the existing system was set up.
