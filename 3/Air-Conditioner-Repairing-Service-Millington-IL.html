The standards do not require you to alter your existing central air conditioning systems, and replacement parts and services should still be available for your home's systems.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate great but Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>I have been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a difficult job that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with customers and keeps men working. When a sales guy comes to your house he is there to sell, that is the only method he is paid.
