<p>The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon a number of aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important influences. In other cases, whether a person responds to a pollutant depends upon private sensitivity, which varies tremendously from individual to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical toxins also.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ may observe musty or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
