<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately positioned or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which may enter close-by ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
