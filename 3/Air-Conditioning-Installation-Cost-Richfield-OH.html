<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>My oldest child always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I realized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The noise level is low and itâ $ s fantastic on energy saving too.<p>
<p>Since immunity varies significantly from specific to private, it is not useful to create a universal standard fit for all in terms of exposure and health. EDLab at Pure Air Control Services performed a 10 year research study examining more than 7,000 buildings and over 25,000 environmental samples that were gathered throughout the United States and abroad. The building type included both commercial and residential. The majority of samples examined were evaluated positive for germs and fungi.<p>
