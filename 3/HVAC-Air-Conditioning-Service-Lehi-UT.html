Sources of formaldehyde in the home include structure materials, smoking, household products, and using unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene area heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a number of purposes in produced products.

<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system parts, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
