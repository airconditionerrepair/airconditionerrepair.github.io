Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

We provide information on local service specialists in addition to their existing Google business ratings, Better Business Bureau ratings, and even current reviews from house owners in your community who also finished HVAC jobs with those same heating and cooling contractors.<p>
