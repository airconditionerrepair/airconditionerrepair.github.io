<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
