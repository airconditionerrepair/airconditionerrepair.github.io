<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
