<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
