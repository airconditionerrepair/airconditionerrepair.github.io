If the exhaust outlets are blocked, they can lead to an unsafe accumulation and jeopardize your safety.

They will search for indications of deterioration, leaks, and back draft and repair the problem during their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
