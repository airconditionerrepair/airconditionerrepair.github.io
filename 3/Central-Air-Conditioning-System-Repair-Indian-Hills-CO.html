<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
