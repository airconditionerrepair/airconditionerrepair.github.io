<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to supply enough modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
