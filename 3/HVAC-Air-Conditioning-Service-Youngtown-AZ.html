<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Youngtown AZ?</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We picked getting something more expensive than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was required and renovated the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater since the specialists believed they simply didn't appear best and they couldn't leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
