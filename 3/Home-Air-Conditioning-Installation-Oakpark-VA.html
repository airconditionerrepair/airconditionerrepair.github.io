<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been stressed out from usage. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the right temperature level.
