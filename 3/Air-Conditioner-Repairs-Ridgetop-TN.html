<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ might see moldy or unpleasant smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse, talk with your doctor about them. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for good building management.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by animals and people; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
