<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>What do you do when the company that's supplying the service contract tries to upsell you each time they concern perform regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for seven years, despite the fact that it was 6 months prior to the existing one expired. She didn't need a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
