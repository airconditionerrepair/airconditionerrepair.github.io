<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Air pollutants can range from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your pets to unsafe gas leaks.
