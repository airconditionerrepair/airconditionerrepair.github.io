<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is likewise proof from animal studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>The guidelines that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same. As soon as the wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly solidify and treat-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
<p>The primary health result connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
