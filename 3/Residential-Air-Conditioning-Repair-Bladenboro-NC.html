<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating equipment can last for years. However if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel costs suddenly appear greater than typical, it is probably time to think about a brand-new system.

Let the system cool down for about 5 minutes prior to resetting any breakers.
