<p>Discover PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers contaminants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage performance rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A really efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon keeping it according to the producer's directions.<p>
<p>If you work in construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator service center or lead factory, or your pastime includes lead, you might unconsciously bring lead into your home on your hands or clothing. You might also be tracking in lead from soil around your house. Soil really near to houses may be infected from lead paint on the outside of the structure. Soil by roadways and highways might be infected from years of exhaust fumes from cars and trucks and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to clean your feet before getting in the house. If you deal with lead in your job or a pastime, alter your clothes before you go home and clean these clothing separately.
