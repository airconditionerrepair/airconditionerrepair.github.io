<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that might impact the health of individuals who live in the house. Pollutants could come from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon going into your home from the ground below.

Bacteria and viruses, animal dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
