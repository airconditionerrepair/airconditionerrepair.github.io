<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, many of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the a/c individually for each room.
