<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
