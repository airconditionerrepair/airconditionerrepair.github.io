<p>The exhaust outlets enable all harmful gases to leave your property so there's no dangerous accumulation of carbon monoxide and other such gases. If the exhaust outlets are clogged, they can lead to a harmful build-up and jeopardize your security. The technician will examine all of these aspects of your system and inspect the chimney flue and vent stack as well. They will try to find indications of rust, leakages, and back draft and repair the issue during their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance items that just a skilled HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in costly compressor failure, but a homeowner doesn't have the tools or abilities essential to examine refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and proper air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the needed devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still essential to have a specialist technician check the system occasionally.<p>
