<p>My eldest boy always complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it really didnÃ¢ $ t distribute air like it did previously. WeÃ¢ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnÃ¢ $ t really think of anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The sound level is itÃ¢ and low $ s terrific on energy conserving too.<p>
