The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
