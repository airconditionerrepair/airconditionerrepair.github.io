In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " top ecological hazard to the health of children in the United States." There are numerous ways in which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, degrading paint, and dust.

To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
