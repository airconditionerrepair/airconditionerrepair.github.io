<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning a business was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it required to construct the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end goal. HVAC entrepreneur should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the very same in all other areas.<p>
