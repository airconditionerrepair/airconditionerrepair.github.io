<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run because it has to run longer than a correctly sized system. Because it just takes more electricity to run a larger system, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate. And an oversize system does not lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In truth, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
