<h3>Commercial Air Conditioning Repair in New Almaden California</h3>

Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed just a few years earlier.<p>
