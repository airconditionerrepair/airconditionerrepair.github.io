<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, because a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
