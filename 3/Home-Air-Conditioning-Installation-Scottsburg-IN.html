<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge toxins.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items include vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. These items provide a threat only when they are handled in a way that creates dust including asbestos fibers which can be breathed in. When asbestos-containing products are damaged or disturbed by repair, renovating, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can end up being air-borne if appropriate controls are not in place. This can lead to the potential for substantial illness.<p>
