What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
