<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. While pollutants frequently discovered in indoor air can trigger numerous harmful effects, there is significant unpredictability about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are essential to produce particular health problems. Individuals also respond very differently to exposure to indoor air pollutants. Further research study is needed to better understand which health effects occur after exposure to the typical pollutant concentrations discovered in houses and which happens from the higher concentrations that happen for brief time periods.<p>
<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your home will not heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
