<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Service in South Greenfield</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating units are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your house won't warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
