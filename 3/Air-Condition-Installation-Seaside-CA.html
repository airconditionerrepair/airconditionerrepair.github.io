<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Seaside CA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating unit. We decided on getting something more pricey than a traditional water heater as gas is among our biggest energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
