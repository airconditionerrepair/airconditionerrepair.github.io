<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. The probability of immediate responses to indoor air contaminants depends on numerous aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether a person reacts to a toxin depends upon specific level of sensitivity, which differs tremendously from person to person. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological or chemical toxins after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>The capability of organic chemicals to trigger health impacts varies significantly, from those that are highly harmful, to those without any known health impact. Just like other contaminants, the extent and nature of the health result will depend upon many elements including level of direct exposure and length of time exposed. Eye and breathing tract inflammation, headaches, dizziness, visual conditions, and memory problems are amongst the immediate symptoms that some individuals have actually experienced soon after direct exposure to some organics. At present, not much is learnt about what health results take place from the levels of organics generally found in homes. Many natural compounds are known to cause cancer in animals; some are believed of triggering, or are known to cause, cancer in human beings.<p>
