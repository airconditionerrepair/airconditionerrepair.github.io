The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power must not surpass the capacity of the outside system.

However, it is incorrect to expect better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the exact same time, given that the total capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that some of the rooms might not have a really comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the overall power is not basic, because it takes into account not only the small power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
