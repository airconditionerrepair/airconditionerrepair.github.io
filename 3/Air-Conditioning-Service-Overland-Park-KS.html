<h3>Is The Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Overland Park KS?</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
