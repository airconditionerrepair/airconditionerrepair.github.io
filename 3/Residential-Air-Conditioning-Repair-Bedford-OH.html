<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the very same.

Do not put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively harden and cure-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
