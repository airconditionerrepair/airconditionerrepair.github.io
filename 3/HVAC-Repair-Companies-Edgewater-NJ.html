He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical material in time.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
