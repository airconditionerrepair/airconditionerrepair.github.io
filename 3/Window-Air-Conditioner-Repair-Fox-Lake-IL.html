<p>It may feel comfortable being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, but for people who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have breathing issues, winter can intensify problems. Stale indoor air and heating unit can increase the amount of allergy-inducing dust mites, pet dander, and mold spores flowing through your home. In late winter and early spring, it might still be too cold to throw open the windows to take out the moldy air, so while you await the warmer weather it is essential to be aware of some of the allergy and respiratory triggers that may be hiding in your environments.<p>
<p>There is no easy answer, however many use the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is most likely a much better service.

<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement tries to upsell you whenever they come to perform routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for seven years, despite the fact that it was 6 months before the present one ended. She didn't need a air filtration system, however they talked her into it.<p>
