Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter.

<h3>What Are Inverted Heat Pumps in Lamar MO?</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the taken in heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>

<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best aspect of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they detected the issue and fixed really rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>

By choosing a central AC unit that has as high of an effectiveness rating as possible, you can decrease your carbon footprint and conserve money in the long run.
