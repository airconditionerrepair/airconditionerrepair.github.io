<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not use them.. Secondly like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to effectively service and the system has been operating problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
