<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized house, which will impact installation costs. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this could be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioning unit and fridges utilized flammable or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
