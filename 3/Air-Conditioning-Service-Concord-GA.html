<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you should examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
