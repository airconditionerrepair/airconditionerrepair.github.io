The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
