<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and individuals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Polluted central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
