If a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
