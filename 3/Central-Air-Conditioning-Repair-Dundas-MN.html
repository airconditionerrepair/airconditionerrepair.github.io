<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
