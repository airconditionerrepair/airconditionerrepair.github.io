To make certain the unit you choose is the right size for your home, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load calculation price quote to identify the exact type of heat and a/c system that's ideal for your home-we do not just replace it with the exact same size unit you currently have.

<p>Radiant heat covers a range of different heating systems, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable concepts.

In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
