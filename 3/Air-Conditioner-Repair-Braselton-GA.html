<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure reality that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is simply as important as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will often build up in ductwork, restricting air flow.

Since a system is set up in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy.

When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
