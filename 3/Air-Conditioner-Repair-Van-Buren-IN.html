<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, many of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
