<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating systems are still widely utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
