<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water.

The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
