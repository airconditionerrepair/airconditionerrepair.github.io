<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
