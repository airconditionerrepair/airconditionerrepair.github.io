Longtime Seattle house owners are lastly giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
