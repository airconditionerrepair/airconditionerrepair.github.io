<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Service in Willow Springs</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace service technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. Because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has an integrated efficiency benefit. Since they don't need any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Due to the fact that a system is installed in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>
