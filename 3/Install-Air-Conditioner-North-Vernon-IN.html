<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
