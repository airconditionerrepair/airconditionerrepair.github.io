<p>My oldest kid constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I understood that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
