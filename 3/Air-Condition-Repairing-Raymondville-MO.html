Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually watched the single-family house installation organisation entirely flip on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not simply with beginners more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are finally giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a referral later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
