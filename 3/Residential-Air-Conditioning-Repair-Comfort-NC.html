<p>Many people ignore the extent of the indoor air pollution problem. Air contamination is normally visualized as the black smoke emitted from factories. Little idea is given to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, cleaners, paints, and pesticides utilized in the house. To intensify the problem, it is estimated that the average American invests 70 percent to 90 percent of his or her time indoors, and more than half that time is spent in the home.<p>
<p>Energy performance can be enhanced a lot more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heater. Zones are managed by several thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is very important to keeping a proper temperature.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, indicating they utilize air to exchange heat, in the same way as a vehicle radiator or typical family a/c unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outdoors air.<p>

If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
