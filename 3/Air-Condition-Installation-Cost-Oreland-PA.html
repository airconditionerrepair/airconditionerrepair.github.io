<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
