<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be serious. They consist of hold-ups in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, infants, and children are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups given that lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the damaging impacts of lead. Children might have higher exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

Since they just partly get rid of the radon decay items and do not reduce the amount of radon entering the house, the efficiency of these gadgets is unsure.

EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, offers more information on air-cleaning devices to decrease indoor air toxins.<p>
