<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace at Tuxedo NC</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit. We decided on getting something more expensive than a standard water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy costs. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>

<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO preserve the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, select your contractor sensibly, much of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating adequate outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
