<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heater. We selected getting something more pricey than a conventional water heater as gas is among our most significant energy expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a recommendation later on).

Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
