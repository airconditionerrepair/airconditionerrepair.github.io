If your furnace is in a very poor condition, possibly it is time to start thinking of buying a brand-new one.<p>
<p>For instance, pollutants might collect within the air diffusers and grills, introducing contaminants into the environment. Or if the outside air intake lies near a source of wetness or other outdoor toxin, it may function as a pathway to carry the impurities inside.
