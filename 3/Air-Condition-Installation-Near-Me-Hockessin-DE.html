<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives ask for assessment and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. The possibility of immediate responses to indoor air toxins depends upon several elements consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions.

<p>The first air conditioners and refrigerators employed harmful or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
