<p>Correct ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with a very old name. The company started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature clients for years, till the mandate for high-efficiency units forced Goettl to end production.

Goodrich's daddy was a Goettl dealer in Las Vegas, so when the opportunity came to buy what was left of the firm in 2013, he took it.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the exact same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking devices will send out the sensing unit information to the cloud, where you can access it by means of software. You get immediate, real-time access to the monitoring results through a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are easy to understand.<p>
