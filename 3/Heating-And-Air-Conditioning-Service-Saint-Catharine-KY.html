When approximating the cost of an installation, a safe cost estimation bracket is between $10 to $20 per square foot dependant on the kind of system you choose for your home.

<p>Not all sensors work the same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're dealing with a Web of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking devices will send out the sensing unit information to the cloud, where you can access it via software. You get instant, real-time access to the monitoring results through a dashboard, which turns the data into visual charts that are easy to figure out.<p>
