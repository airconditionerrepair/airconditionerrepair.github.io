We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to remove the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater. We chose getting something more costly than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
