<p>Geothermal heat pumps are extremely effective, because ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is always at a continuous temperature. These systems can obtain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just achieve an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other types of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). COP rates how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling effect. Many ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for every single system of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, roughly 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the kind of heat.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the space temperature level, and after that switch it ON.
