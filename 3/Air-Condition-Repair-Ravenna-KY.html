<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Ravenna KY Home Owners</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing pattern in house building and construction is to decrease air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofs, walls, and floorings. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor impurities and helps tire them from the house.<p>
