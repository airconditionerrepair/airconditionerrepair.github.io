<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Selma NC?</h3>

Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The lowered airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked.

Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>
