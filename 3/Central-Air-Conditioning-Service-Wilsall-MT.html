<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Wilsall MT?</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in home building and construction is to decrease air leakage through cracks and other openings in floors, roofings, and walls. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air helps and dilutes indoor pollutants tire them from the house.<p>
