<p>Sean was very practical. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault.

Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
