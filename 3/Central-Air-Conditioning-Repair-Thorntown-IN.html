<p>A health questionnaire must be developed and distributed to all worried employees. Such a tool ought to recognize the number of people affected; specify ages and job descriptions of involved employees; determine where they are located within the office; suggest when the symptoms happen (time of day, day of week, and season); provide a list of particular health symptoms or health problems; identify all machines operated in the workplace; show the kind of outside air pollution; and identify potential sources of job tension.<p>
<p>We take a look at ideas prior to we supply suggestions to replace rather than repair a heating system. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy.
