<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
