<p>Usually the most reliable method to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions.

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
