<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure truth that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is just as important as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will typically build up in ductwork, restricting airflow.

Next, shut off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Image 2).
