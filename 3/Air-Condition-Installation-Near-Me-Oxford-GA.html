<h3>How To Pick An HVAC Company in Oxford GA</h3>
<p>The rest of the HVAC system also needs to be in leading condition for the air conditioning unit to work well. This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which reside inside the house. If the private parts remain in correct order, the technician can take a look at the ductwork for indications of holes, spaces or excessive dirt. Sealing leaks in ductwork can enhance HVAC effectiveness by as much as 30 percent, and provide for a cooler house in the hot summer season.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
