<p>In an area where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good primary heating systems. You'll wish to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing. If temperature levels reach and drop listed below freezing, your heating technician can set up controls which immediately shut down the heat pump. The controls will require the furnace to come on, effectively heating the home in these conditions.<p>
<p>Similar to a lot of home improvement jobs, the cost of a full central heating unit can differ widely based upon the size of the home. The majority of heaters will last in between 15 and 20 years. In picking a furnace, property owners must think about heat output and effectiveness. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the home. A small house, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too rapidly and turn off for too long, resulting in irregular temperature level levels.<p>
