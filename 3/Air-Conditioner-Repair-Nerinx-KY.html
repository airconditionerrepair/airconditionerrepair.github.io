<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements used for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might also be necessary.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as important when it comes to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, however will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to correctly cool the home on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two must not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC take advantage of the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is used for producing power in the form of electrical power. The two operations use different processes, with geothermal energy needing water be heated up to boiling point to attain its aims.<p>
