This lessens the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the ac system into a heat pump While room air conditioning supplies maximum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is usually more expensive than central air.<p>
