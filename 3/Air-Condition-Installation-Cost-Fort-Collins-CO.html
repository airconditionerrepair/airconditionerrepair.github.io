<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Fort Collins CO?</h3>
<p>Sean was very helpful. He is a very pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to purchase additional stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
