<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the typical home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
