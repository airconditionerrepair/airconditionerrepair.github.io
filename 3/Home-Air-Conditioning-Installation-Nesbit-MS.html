<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Nesbit MS</h3>
<p>Area Ventilation. Outside exhaust fans need to be installed in all cooking areas and restrooms. These fans remove humidity and carbon monoxide gas. The most reliable fans are quiet and long lasting. Use fans that operate at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans equipped with timers or de-humidistat controls are useful to ensure the fans run for a sufficient amount of time. An excellent guideline is to run a bathroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
