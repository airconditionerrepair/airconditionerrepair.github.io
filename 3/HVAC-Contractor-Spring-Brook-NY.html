<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as created. Wetness management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the greater temperatures in some cases used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to offer thermal comfort inside your home. However, high humidity outdoors creates the requirement for cautious attention to humidity levels inside your home. High humidities give rise to mold development and moisture inside your home is related to a greater occurrence of resident respiratory problems.<p>
