<p>You're most likely hearing the fan motor trying to start without the boost it needs from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz.

However the chances are excellent that this may work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to change the capacitor.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went completely dead.
