<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you should check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
