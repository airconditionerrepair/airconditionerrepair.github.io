Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
