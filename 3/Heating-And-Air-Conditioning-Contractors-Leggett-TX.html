<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
