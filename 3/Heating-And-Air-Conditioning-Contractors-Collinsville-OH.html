<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Terrific service within 24 hours and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and very comprehensive in discussing what services would be carried out. Likewise Camryn provided great client service at the end of the consultation by describing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of recommendations of some maintenance jobs we may wish to have carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques employed by some in the market.<p>
<p>Generally the most efficient way to improve indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to decrease the amount of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient technique to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later in this section.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by animals and people; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become airborne. Polluted central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>
