<p>Self-installation tends to create more problems than it fixes.

<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was sort of strange being that package was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was exceptionally lite weight and requires time to apply. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with assistance, we dealt with concerns. I would suggest this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
