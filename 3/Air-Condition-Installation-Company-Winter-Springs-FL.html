<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. As soon as the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively treat and harden-- usually two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
