Insulation might be a more efficient service to your cooling problems than replacing your equipment.<p>

<h3>Common Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Thayer MO</h3>
<p>Geothermal heatpump are extremely efficient, due to the fact that ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is always at a continuous temperature. These systems can attain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just obtain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE rates how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling effect. The majority of ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this indicates is that for every unit of energy utilized by a geothermal heat pump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the type of heat.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
