OSHA, NIOSH and others have set NO2 requirements, and the World Health Company (WHO) has actually set guidelines for both-- including for indoor air.<p>
<p>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is devoted to providing a work environment that is devoid of acknowledged risks and to investigation grievances that might be connected to bad indoor air quality (IAQ). Though specific policies have actually not been developed for IAQ in the work location, the Environment, Health And Wellness Department (EHS) considers suggestions from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Cooling Engineers (ASHRAE).<p>
