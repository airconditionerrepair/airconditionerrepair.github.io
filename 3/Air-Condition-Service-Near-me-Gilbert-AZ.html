They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they had to order it. My other half stated that she had actually seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He provided to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most good individuals I have actually met in a very long time.

If you have actually set up the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

Purchased a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
