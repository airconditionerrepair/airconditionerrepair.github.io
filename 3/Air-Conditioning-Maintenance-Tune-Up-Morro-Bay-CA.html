<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years approximately. Unscrew the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Image 6).<p>

<p>Great Product! Delivery was type of unusual being that the box was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was extremely lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we fixed concerns. I would recommend this product to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>Fights the hot days: Though most temperatures in Seattle are acceptably average, you can expect a minimum of one month during which temperatures will reach above 80 degrees. There were 45 days above 80 last year! Just a couple of years back, Seattle saw a record temperature level of 103 degrees, and there have actually been lots of long, dry, hot streaks since then. When the heat gets excruciating, a central air conditioning system in your house suggests you have the power to change the temperature level to a constant temperature level.<p>
