Instead of a simple sales job, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heating unit and situated ways we could have more even heat. He included these substantial but small changes in his bid. Because of current warmer summer seasons and for ecological reasons, we decided to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>

These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions call for.

Furthermore, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>First make sure the air filter is clean and in good condition if you see a decrease in heat output. Next, check other elements of the furnace for any build-up of dirt, debris and dust, an affordable repair that can assist improve performance. Likewise, inspect the vents and ducts for blockage. Lastly, make sure the thermostat is working and positioned appropriately. Try moving it far from direct sunlight since this may affect temperature level readings on the thermostat and cause it to misread the temperature in your house.
