Instead of a simple sales job, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heating unit and situated ways we could have more even heat. He included these substantial but small changes in his bid. Because of current warmer summer seasons and for ecological reasons, we decided to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>

Next, check other elements of the furnace for any build-up of dirt, debris and dust, an affordable repair that can assist improve performance. Likewise, inspect the vents and ducts for blockage.
