<h3>The Way to Receive Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing at Leeds AL</h3>
<p>Co2 (CO2) is a relatively simple to measure surrogate for indoor toxins given off by humans, and associates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high indoors may cause occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the main indoor source of co2 in most buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Dometic's commercial grade rooftop air conditioning unit are performance-tested to conquer uncommon or severe road and weather conditions. Many standard systems break down after simply four hours of extreme vibration screening, while the Vigorous II is still going strong at 30 hours and more! The galvanized steel leading plate provides lasting strength while long copper lines minimize vibration and, therefore, noise too.

<p>We look at clues before we provide guidance to change instead of repair a heating system. One of the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are greater year after year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing cash by not changing the older unit.<p>

Other elements such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how people react to the indoor environment.<p>
