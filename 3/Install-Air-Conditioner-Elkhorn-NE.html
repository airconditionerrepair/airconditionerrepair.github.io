<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Repair in Elkhorn NE</h3>
<p>I usually don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
