The unit runs silently and effectively, but to have 2 major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by guarantee.
