<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in.

Outdoor PM, created by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
