<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my request.

He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Paradise TX</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
