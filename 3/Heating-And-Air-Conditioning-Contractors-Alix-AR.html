<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth.

<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature level, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
