<p>Information provided in this security guide is based on current scientific and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders established by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies. The requirements do not require you to change your existing central air conditioning systems, and replacement parts and services should still be available for your home's systems.

<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your house will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
