Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
