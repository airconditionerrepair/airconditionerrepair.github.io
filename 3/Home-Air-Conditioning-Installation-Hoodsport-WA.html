<p>It's a truth that a brand-new furnace for your home is among the more significant costs associated with home ownership. But, it must also be viewed as a long-term financial investment. All of the latest heaters are far more energy-efficient than those installed even twenty years earlier. So, while it might look like a short-term larger expense, a brand-new, more energy-efficient home heating system will more than likely save you money in the longer-term by reducing your annual energy costs.<p>
<p>Oil heaters are generally not extremely effective. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, but many do not accomplish an efficiency higher than 90%. A couple of high-end brands have an efficiency of 95% by using a condenser. These are more expensive, having starting costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Since a drain needs to be set up, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
