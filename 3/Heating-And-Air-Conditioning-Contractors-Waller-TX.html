<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to supply enough modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this.
