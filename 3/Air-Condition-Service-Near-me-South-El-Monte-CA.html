<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ might notice undesirable or musty smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues.

But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>
