<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the production of an aerosol result, the majority of frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly positioned or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might go into nearby ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and retirement home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outside fountains in public tourist attractions.
