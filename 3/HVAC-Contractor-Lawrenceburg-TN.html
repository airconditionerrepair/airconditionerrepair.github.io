<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
