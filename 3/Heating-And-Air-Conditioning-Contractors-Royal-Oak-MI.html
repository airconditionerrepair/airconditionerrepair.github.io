<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
