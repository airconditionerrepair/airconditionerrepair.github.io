Hence, for many individuals, the dangers to health might be greater due to direct exposure to air contamination inside your home than outdoors.<p>

AC system costs start at $2,000 and can actually go beyond $10,000 for larger houses. As you saw recently, you need an appropriately-sized unit for your house.
