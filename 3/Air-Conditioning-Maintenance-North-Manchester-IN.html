Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they provide me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding noises. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems may be belt-driven. Squealing sounds from a belt-drive air handler generally happen when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. In many cases, the belt is incorrectly aligned or used and needs replacement. Follow the directions above under Air Conditioner Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>
