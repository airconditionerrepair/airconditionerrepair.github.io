<h3>Get Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Currie NC</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Inspect these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
