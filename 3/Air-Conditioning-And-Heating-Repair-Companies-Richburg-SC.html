<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. An oversize compressor also costs more to run because it merely takes more electrical power to run a larger system. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
