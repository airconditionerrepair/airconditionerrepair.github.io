<p>Recently, Target told reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the initial intrusion into its systems was traced back to network credentials that were taken from a 3rd party vendor. Sources now tell KrebsOnSecurity that the vendor in question was a heating, air and refrigeration  conditioning subcontractor that has actually worked at a variety of locations at Target and other leading merchants.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
