<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and effectively, but to have two significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>Particular immediate results are similar to those from colds or other viral illness, so it is frequently tough to identify if the symptoms are a result of direct exposure to indoor air pollution.

<h3>Furnace Installation Cost in Uniontown OH</h3>
<p>I generally don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
