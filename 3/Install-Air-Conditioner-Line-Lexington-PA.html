<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use vehicle debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
