<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
