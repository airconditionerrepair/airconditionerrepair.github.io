<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on.

The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
