<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
