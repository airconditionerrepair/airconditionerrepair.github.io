<p>When our furnace was dying, we contacted two local companies for quotes. While both were informative and handy, Ballard Gas provided us a better deal, for extraordinary service. Rather than a basic sales task, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heating system and situated ways we could have more even heat. He consisted of these substantial however minor modifications in his quote. We chose to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump since of recent warmer summertimes and for ecological factors.<p>
<p>We have actually been incredibly pleased with Integrity's devices (Trane dealership) and service (today Braxten completed yearly maintenance of our system). Trane heatpump has actually worked very well and is so effective that it significantly reduced our utility expenditures - the system will pay for itself in less than 5 years.
