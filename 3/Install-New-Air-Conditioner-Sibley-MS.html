<p>Your Review This is my third time using Around the Clock. Ilan constantly makes himself available - whether it's a heating concern in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more routine calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is experienced with these gadgets).

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
