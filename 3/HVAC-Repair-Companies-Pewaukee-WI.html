He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely useful in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to momentarily deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day.

<p>The predominant health impact connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
