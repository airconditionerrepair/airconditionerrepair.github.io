Of course, too-dry air can also aggravate your sinuses and lungs, while too much indoor humidity can add to the growth of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a home is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>This is particularly significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
