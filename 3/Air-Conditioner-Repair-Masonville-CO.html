<p>We take a look at clues before we provide recommendations to replace instead of repair a heating system. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy.

It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing cash by not changing the older system.<p>
