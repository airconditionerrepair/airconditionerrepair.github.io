<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
