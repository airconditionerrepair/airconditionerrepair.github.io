<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
