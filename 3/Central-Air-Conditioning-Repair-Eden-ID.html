<p>We called Elite HEATING AND COOLING on among the most popular days of summer( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to examine circumstance & chose to opt for them for the work. I more than happy to say that not just did we get the central air going but likewise changed the heating system which was old. Everybody we spoke to from beginning to end were very professional, polite and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air units is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Think about an entire house dehumidifier if your single stage air conditioner isn't old adequate to validate replacement.

The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, improving indoor air quality and allowing higher comfort at greater temperatures.<p>
