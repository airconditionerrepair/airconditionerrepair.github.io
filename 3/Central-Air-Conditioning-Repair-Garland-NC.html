<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heaters are still widely utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air conditioning unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioners are more energy efficient than models made 5 years earlier, so it makes monetary sense to change or update your unit if it's 5 years of ages or older. The best central air conditioning conditioner you can purchase today will use 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while providing the exact same amount of cooling.<p>
