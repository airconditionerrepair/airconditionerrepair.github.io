<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite significant.<p>
