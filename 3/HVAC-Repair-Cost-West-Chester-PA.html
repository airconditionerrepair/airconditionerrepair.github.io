<h3>What to Think about when Buying a Heat Pump in West Chester PA</h3>
<p>Sean was very useful. He is a very enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to buy additional stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not offer them.  Secondly like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to effectively service and the system has actually been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
