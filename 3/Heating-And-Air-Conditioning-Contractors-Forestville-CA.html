<p>If the AC does not shut off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not release heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur with time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts.
