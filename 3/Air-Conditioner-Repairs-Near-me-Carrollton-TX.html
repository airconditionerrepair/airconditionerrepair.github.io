<h3>The Way Central Heating Boilers Keep Your Carrollton TX Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on different house effectiveness upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest cost savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's services and products was outstanding. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a sensible level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while permitting me to perform the required electrical improvements to save money on cost.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
