<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
