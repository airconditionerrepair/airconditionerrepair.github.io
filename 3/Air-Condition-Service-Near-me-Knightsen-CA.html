They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to buy it. My partner said that she had actually seen a great review for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good individuals I have met in a long time. If we wish to have alternatives to ACME heating, we need to support the real individuals who are there for us.
