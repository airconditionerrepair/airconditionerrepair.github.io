<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their total power needs to not go beyond the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units greater than the outdoor capability by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, because the overall capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outside unit. Basically, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that a few of the rooms may not have a really comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the total power is not easy, given that it considers not only the nominal power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
