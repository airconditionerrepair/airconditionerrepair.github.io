<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that measure the height and width of the opening. Be sure to have those dimensions on hand when buying an a/c to ensure it'll fit easily into the window.

<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might choose to change the outdoor compressor with a modern, high-efficiency unit. Seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the new compressor is correctly matched to the indoor system if you do so. Nevertheless, thinking about current modifications in refrigerants and cooling styles, it may be wiser to replace the entire system.<p>
