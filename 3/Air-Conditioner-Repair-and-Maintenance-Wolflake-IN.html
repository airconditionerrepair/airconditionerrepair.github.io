<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that measure the height and width of the opening. Be sure to have those dimensions on hand when buying an a/c to ensure it'll fit easily into the window.

Nevertheless, thinking about current modifications in refrigerants and cooling styles, it may be wiser to replace the entire system.<p>
