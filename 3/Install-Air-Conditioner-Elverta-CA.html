Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.

If we do decide to offer car debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
