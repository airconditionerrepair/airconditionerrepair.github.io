<p>I am replacing our High Speed System because of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>With the cost of electricity and gas increasing, it is necessary to have your furnace tuned-up for optimum energy cost savings. This will keep you from needlessly paying more than you should. Paragon Heating & Home Convenience Solutions Combustion Optimization & Safety Examination of your furnace includes a Performance Check-Up, in which the thermostat is checked for accuracy and the burners are adjusted for maximum efficiency. Paragon Heating & Home Comfort Solutions DOES NOT utilize the worthless 'eyeball the flame' method that other companies utilize. Rather, the combustion is enhanced by determining the exhaust gasses and making clinical changes. This alone might pay for the entire maintenance go to at today's cost of gas.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items include vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. When they are dealt with in a method that produces dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be breathed in, these products present a threat only. When asbestos-containing materials are damaged or disturbed by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can become air-borne if proper controls are not in location. This can lead to the capacity for substantial health issue.<p>
