<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Because pesticides can be found far from the website of their original application, it is prudent to reduce the use of chemical pesticides outdoors along with inside your home. Depending upon the website and pest to be managed, one or more of the following steps can be effective: use of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; selection of disease-resistant plants; and regular cleaning of indoor plants and family pets. Termite damage can be lowered or avoided by making certain that wooden building products do not enter direct contact with the soil and by keeping firewood away from the house. By properly fertilizing, watering, and aerating yards, the requirement for chemical pesticide treatments of yards can be significantly minimized.<p>
