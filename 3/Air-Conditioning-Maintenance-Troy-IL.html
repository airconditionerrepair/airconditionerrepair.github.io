<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
