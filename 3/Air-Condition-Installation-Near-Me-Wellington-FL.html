<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set stronger indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor appliances through codes, and after more powerful guidelines are set there is a chance to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>A/c can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
