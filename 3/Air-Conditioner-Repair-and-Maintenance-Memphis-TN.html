<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on.

Before that takes place, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
