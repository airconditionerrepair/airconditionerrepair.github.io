<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. If goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
