<p>The possibility of instant reactions to indoor air toxins depends on a number of aspects. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 crucial influences. In other cases, whether an individual responds to a pollutant depends upon private sensitivity, which differs enormously from individual to person. Some people can become sensitized to biological toxins after duplicated direct exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical toxins too.<p>
<p>Some biological contaminants set off allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma. Transmittable illnesses, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Mildews and molds launch disease-causing toxins. Symptoms of health problems caused by biological pollutants include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, sleepiness, fever, and digestion problems.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
