A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which frequently release water in an aerosol which might get in neighboring ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical facilities and assisted living home, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outdoor fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
