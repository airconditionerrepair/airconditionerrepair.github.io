<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power should not exceed the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems higher than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the very same time, considering that the overall capability of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor system. Basically, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that some of the rooms might not have a really comfy temperature level. However, the estimation of the overall power is not simple, because it takes into consideration not just the small power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

<p>A customized air conditioning unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic a/c in that both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the very same air course. Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, because all components of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same room, no heat is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is in fact warmed, just as by an electric heater that draws the same amount of power.<p>
