The efficiency of these devices is uncertain since they only partially remove the radon decay items and do not diminish the amount of radon entering the home.

EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, provides further details on air-cleaning devices to lower indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>We advise utilizing our insulation boards when setting up over concrete slabs. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash when used in combination with underfloor heating by functioning as an extremely efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of permitting heat to heat up the concrete slab below.
