<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you need to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
