<h3>Heating Strategies For Gas Home Furnaces at Lodi NJ</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even little window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or washed as conditions call for. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
