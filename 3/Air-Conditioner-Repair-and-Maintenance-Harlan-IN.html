We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater. We chose getting something more expensive than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy costs.

If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
