<h3>HVAC Repair And You - What You Need to Know in Okeana OH</h3>

After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. Sometimes, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
