<p>Today, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold might be residing in your house's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe along with the effectiveness of your heating and air conditioning system. There are several design approaches in use today; however, all ground source heatpump run with similar principles. Every one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources also dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area.

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace kicks in which abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off.<p>

This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioner into a heat pump While room cooling supplies optimum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is generally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
