<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance in Tomkins Cove NY</h3>

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a reference later). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
