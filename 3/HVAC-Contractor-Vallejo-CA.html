<p>The purpose of a lot of building ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for resident convenience while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and constructing security at affordable energy costs. Load determining is described as the Manual J calculation and ought to be performed by the HVAC contractor before providing an installation or system cost for a/c. If your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning system you require based on experience or on square footage alone, transfer to another contractor. Just like determining the size of a system needed based upon BTUs, figuring out the proper size of system for your home also depends on the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
