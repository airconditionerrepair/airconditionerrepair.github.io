<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis.

This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
