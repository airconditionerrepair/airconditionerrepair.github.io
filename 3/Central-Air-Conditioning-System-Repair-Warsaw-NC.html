<p>Similar to the majority of house improvement tasks, the cost of a complete central heater can vary commonly based upon the size of the house. The majority of furnaces will last between 15 and 20 years. In choosing a furnace, property owners need to think about heat output and performance. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace need to be matched to the size of the home. A small home, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too rapidly and turn off for too long, leading to inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
