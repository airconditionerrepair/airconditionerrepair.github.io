<p>A Lot Of Midtown Houston Tx customers do not know why their HVAC unit is not working when they place a 24 hr emergency ac repair demand. The copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's most likely your problem. If you discovered that your conditioning filter requires replacing, then the next action is to defrost your air conditioning devices.
