<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning an organisation was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't the end objective.
