<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor carefully, a lot of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>A packaged system, typically set up on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, however it is likewise an alternative for property owners to think about. Oftentimes, these systems include not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, given that the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are typically just offered for larger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best alternative for property owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
