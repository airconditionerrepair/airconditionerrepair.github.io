<p>An undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate since it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit.

That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>
