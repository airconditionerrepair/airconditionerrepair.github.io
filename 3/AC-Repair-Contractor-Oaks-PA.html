<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heaters are still extensively used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>The very first ac system and refrigerators utilized combustible or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
