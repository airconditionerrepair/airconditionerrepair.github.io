<p>UW students, visitors and workers ought to have a tidy, healthy environment in which to work, study and perform numerous activities. If the air quality is bad it can impact an individual's performance, health, and convenience.  The function of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) program is to supply and preserve comfy and healthy environments without impurities. A key part of the program is responding to and fixing concerns of building occupants about problems in their workplace.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide need to be adjusted frequently, and outside measurements used for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
<p>Finally, if you do identify a particularly energy-efficient in-floor heating system and choose to install it in your home, you might be eligible for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor expenses.

Consult the U.S. Department of Energy's Database of State Rewards for Renewable Resource (DSIRE) to see if there are rebates, loans or tax deductions available for the installation of a more efficient in-floor heating system where you live.<p>
<p>Almost half of Americans use air fresheners at least as soon as a week, and 34 percent use candle lights or incense that often, our nationally representative study found. Roughly 40 percent hardly ever or never clean their humidifier or kitchen variety hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have actually never ever cleaned or replaced their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can intensify indoor air quality.<p>
