<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical product with time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
