<p>Sean was really practical. He is a very pleasant individual to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work.

No extra charge.<p>

<p>I usually do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
