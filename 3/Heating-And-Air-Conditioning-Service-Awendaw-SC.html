<p>My eldest boy constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually consider anything else except changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is itâ and low $ s great on energy saving too.<p>
