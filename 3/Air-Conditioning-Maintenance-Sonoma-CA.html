<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
