<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
