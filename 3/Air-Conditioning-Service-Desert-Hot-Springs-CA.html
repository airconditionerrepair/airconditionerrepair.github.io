Most owners stick with the larger companies after acquisition. In some cases, the acquisition provides a way for the seller to retire and make certain employees are taken care of.

<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, specifically if the objective of owning a business was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it required to build business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't completion objective. HVAC business owners need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the exact same in all other locations.<p>
