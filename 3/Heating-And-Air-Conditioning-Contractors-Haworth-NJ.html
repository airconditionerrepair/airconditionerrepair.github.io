Filthy filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases cause the system to shut down entirely.

As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<h3>Heating And Cooling Companies in Haworth NJ</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
