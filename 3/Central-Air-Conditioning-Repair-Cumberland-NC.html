<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is a very enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
