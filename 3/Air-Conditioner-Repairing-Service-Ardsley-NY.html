<h3>The Way to Get the Best Gas Furnace For Your Home in Ardsley NY</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, determined particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
