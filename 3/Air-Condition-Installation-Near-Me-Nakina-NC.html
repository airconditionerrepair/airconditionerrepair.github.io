<h3>AC Repair Contractor in Nakina NC</h3>
<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have integrated hold-up features. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. In time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
