<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was type of odd being that package was opened and items could have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The item was extremely lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.

Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.

But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
