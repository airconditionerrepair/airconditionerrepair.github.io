Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio where the unit sits. I feel like they offer me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>
