<p>I am replacing our High Speed System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an extra $2,818.00 to set up a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release contaminants.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>This review is for replacing a 17 year old AC with a new AC, humidifier, air filtration system and thermostat. The technician who explained our choices did an excellent job in making sure we understood the pros and cons of each choice. The service technicians who set up the new system were expert and fast, while taking time to make sure we understood how the brand-new system worked. In general a first rate experience.<p>
