Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, occasionally connected to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
