<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ might notice moldy or unpleasant smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems.

However not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for excellent structure management.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to offer adequate changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A common element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
