<p>The life expectancy of a central air system is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning system are more energy effective than designs made 5 years ago, so it makes financial sense to change or update your unit if it's five years old or older.

Be sure to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we solved issues. I would recommend this item to anybody who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the very first time.
