In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c boost. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
