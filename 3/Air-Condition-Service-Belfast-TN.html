From one of the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some standard maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping airborne toxins flowing through your system.
