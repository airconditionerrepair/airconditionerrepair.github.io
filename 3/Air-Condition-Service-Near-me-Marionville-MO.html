<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you must look out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
