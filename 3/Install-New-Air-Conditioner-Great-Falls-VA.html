<p>Buildings are created or planned to react actively to some of these modifications in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean up, sanitize, and preserve surfaces to boost their longevity, efficiency, or appearance. In other cases, such modifications discreetly or perhaps dramatically modify buildings in ways that might be necessary to their own integrity or their influence on building residents through the advancement of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We may discover it useful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, particularly, some of the methods used by scientists studying environments, in order to gain an improved understanding of the environments in which we invest most of our time, our structures.<p>

<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the very same.

Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
