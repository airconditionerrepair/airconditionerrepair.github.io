<h3>Types of HVAC Repairs in North Chicago IL</h3>
<p>The types of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are as various as the different homes they serve (single family houses, duplexes, mobile homes, houses, high-rise condominiums, row real estate, etc.). No matter what the type of home HVAC system, appropriate air circulation (ventilation), appropriate filtering, and humidity control all add to a healthy indoor air environment. > Likewise, regular maintenance of the HVAC system will guarantee that it is operating securely and not adding to or triggering an indoor air problem.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things initially. Make sure all the signs up in your house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>
