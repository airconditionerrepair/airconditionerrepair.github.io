<p>I generally don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
