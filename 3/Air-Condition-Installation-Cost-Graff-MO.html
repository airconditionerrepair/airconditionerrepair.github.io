<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that wetness needs to go somewhere. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just requesting for mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri. Mentioning laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a reliable and uncomplicated technique to lower ambient air contamination and potential health dangers, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>Generally the most efficient method to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate specific sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to reduce the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more affordable approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later in this section.<p>
<p>Depending upon where in the United States your house is located, the local region's environment can alter dramatically.
