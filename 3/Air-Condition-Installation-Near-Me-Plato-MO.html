<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. In time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>Remember, too, that you may want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump units can have different heating and cooling capacities.
