<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
