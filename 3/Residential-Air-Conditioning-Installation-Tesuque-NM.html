PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the ac system into a heatpump While room cooling supplies maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of spaces at a time it is normally more pricey than central air.<p>
