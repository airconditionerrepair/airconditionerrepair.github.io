<p>We advise using our insulation boards when setting up over concrete slabs. When utilized in combination with underfloor heating by acting as a really effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of permitting heat to heat up the concrete piece below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
