<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment.

Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
