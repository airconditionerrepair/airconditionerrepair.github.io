<p>Sean was very useful. He is an extremely enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
