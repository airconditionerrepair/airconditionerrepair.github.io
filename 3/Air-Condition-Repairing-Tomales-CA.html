<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Ensure all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
