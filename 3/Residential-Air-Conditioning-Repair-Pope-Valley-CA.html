However, many of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Localized radiant flooring heat systems to be utilized in one or a number of rooms like restrooms, kitchens or laundry rooms are easily renovated with electric radiant floor heat. This is far more economical on a smaller sized scale. Larger restorations like additions to a house might be suitable for a larger scale and more pricey hydronic system.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odor free gas that interferes with the delivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can trigger unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can trigger a series of symptoms from headaches, d izziness, weakness, disorientation, queasiness, and confusion, to fatigue in healthy individuals and episodes of increased chest pain in people with chronic cardiovascular disease. The signs of carbon monoxide poisoning are sometimes puzzled with the flu or gastrointestinal disorder. Fetuses, infants, senior individuals, and people with anemia or with a history of heart or respiratory illness can be particularly sensitive to carbon monoxide exposures.<p>
