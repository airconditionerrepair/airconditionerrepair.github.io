<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Hazardous direct exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is improperly removed from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.

<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c unit works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
