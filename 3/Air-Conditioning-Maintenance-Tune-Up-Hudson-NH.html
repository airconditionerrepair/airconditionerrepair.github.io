<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, but furnace service technicians frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>There are lots of things to think about when attempting to determine how frequently I need to replace my cooling filters. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has a distinct DNA on how it builds up dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how often your cooling filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better ideal choice on how often your HVAC filters need changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less typically you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 homes with just one cooling filter require changing more frequently.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not use car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
