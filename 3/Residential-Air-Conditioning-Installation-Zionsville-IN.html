<p>The first air conditioning system and fridges used flammable or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to deadly accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>Air flow patterns in building are determined by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Air pressure distinctions developed by these forces move airborne contaminants from areas of greater pressure to locations of lower pressure through any readily available opening in building walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move till the inside pressure is equal to the outside.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<h3>Gas Furnace Service in Zionsville IN</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss choices. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
