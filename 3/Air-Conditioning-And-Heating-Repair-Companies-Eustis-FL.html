<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not use car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
