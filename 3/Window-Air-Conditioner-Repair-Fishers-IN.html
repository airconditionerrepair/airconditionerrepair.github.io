<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance.

No extra charge.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide must be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
