<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<h3>Passive Ventilation in Worden IL</h3>
<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As an initial step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor guidelines based on the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to manage indoor appliances through codes, and after more powerful standards are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements used for calculations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
