<p>Another method to reducing the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your home is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming indoors. Many home heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window ac system with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of impurities straight from the space where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>

You should also think about replacement if your furnace needs regular repairs and the quantities are starting to get out of hand. If you are lined up with a quality heating unit professional, you will get the recommendations you require on when to go with replacement.<p>
