<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Livingston NJ</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is a really enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure applied to purchase additional things. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only factor he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
