<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit increase. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>Occupational exposure limitations utilize dose-response data which show the health effects of repetitive exposure to one particular chemical. Comparable data is not readily available for long-term, low-level direct exposures to a combination of contaminants as is the case for IAQ problems. Currently, there is insufficient info offered to forecast the results of exposure to several possibly damaging agents at the very same time.<p>
