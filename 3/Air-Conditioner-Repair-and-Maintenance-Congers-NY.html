For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will require to have the filters altered regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation.
