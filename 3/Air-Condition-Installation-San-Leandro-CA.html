<h3>Hot Water Heating System in San Leandro CA</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise changes roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Great service within 24 hr and a reasonable price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and very extensive in discussing what services would be carried out. Similarly Camryn offered terrific customer care at the end of the consultation by describing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater.
