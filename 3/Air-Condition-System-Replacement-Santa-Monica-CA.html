They utilize a series of estimations based upon the British Thermal Units or BTUs required to heat the area. The larger the area, the more effective the house heating system needs to be. For currently constructed home heating systems, the contractor will need to eliminate the old furnace to add the brand-new one. These charges will be included in the installation costs.<p>
