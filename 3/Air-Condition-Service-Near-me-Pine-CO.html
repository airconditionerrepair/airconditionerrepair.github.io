Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
