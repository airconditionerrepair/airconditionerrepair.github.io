Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then determine the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit comfortably into the window, be sure to have those dimensions on hand.

<p>Unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from products or processes; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within throughout water usage.<p>
