<p>If you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else might come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to buy it. My better half said that she had seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall.
