<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine elements. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs dealt with by professionals, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
