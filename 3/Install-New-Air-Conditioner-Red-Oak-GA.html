<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not use them.. Second of all like extended car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients fairly.

The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to properly service and the system has been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
