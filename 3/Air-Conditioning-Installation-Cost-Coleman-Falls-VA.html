Not only was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
