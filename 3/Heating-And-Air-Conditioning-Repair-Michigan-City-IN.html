<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>

<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they provide me priority and a lower rate.

Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
