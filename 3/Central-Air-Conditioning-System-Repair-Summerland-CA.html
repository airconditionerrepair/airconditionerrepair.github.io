<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)
