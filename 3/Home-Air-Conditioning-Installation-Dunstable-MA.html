Buildings continuously evolve as a result of the modifications in the environment around them along with the residents, materials, and activities within them.

<p>Structures are created or intended to respond actively to some of these changes around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sanitize, and preserve surfaces to boost their appearance, efficiency, or durability. In other cases, such modifications discreetly or perhaps drastically alter buildings in manner ins which may be important to their own stability or their effect on building residents through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time.
