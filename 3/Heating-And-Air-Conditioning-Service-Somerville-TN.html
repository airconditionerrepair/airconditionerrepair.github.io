<p>Measurement treatments are being established and demonstrated to examine structure ventilation and indoor toxin concentrations. These procedures vary from sophisticated tracer gas techniques used mainly in developing research efforts to less involved procedures that can be employed by constructing operators.

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect impacting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level.
