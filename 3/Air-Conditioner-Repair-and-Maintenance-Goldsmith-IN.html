<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must watch out for. First, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
