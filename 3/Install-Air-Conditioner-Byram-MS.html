<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather substantial.<p>
