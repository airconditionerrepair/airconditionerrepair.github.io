<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be turned off completely.<p>

More recent gas boilers must attain 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers should achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
