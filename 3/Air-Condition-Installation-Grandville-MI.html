<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance items that just an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to pricey compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the abilities or tools necessary to check refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and proper air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, but house owners lack the essential devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician examine the system occasionally.<p>
<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years back and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around repairing the problem, all the while describing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
