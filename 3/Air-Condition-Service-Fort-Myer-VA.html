<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also regulating the temperature of the flooring. All electrical wiring for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>We look at clues before we provide suggestions to replace rather than repair a heating unit. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are greater year after year, we know the system is not running effectively. It may be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be losing cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
