<p>Oil furnaces are normally not extremely effective. They use less fuel than other furnace types, but the majority of do not attain an effectiveness greater than 90%. A few high-end brand names have a performance of 95% by using a condenser. These are more expensive, having starting expenses for the furnace itself at around $5,000.

<p>Normally the most efficient method to enhance indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of pollution or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the quantity of emissions.

<p>No matter what kind of heater you have in your house, you can conserve money and increase your comfort by appropriately preserving and upgrading your devices.
