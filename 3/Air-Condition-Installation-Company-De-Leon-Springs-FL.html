<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a reference in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
