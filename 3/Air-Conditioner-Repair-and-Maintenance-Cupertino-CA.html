<p>Power Vac America offers commercial, commercial, institutional, residential and marine air duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning company. The key portion of your a/c is the outside system. Without it, you have no cooling. Depending on its placement on your property and its upkeep, it might sustain some damage throughout the winter season. Most of the time, this just consists of some buildup of dirt and debris, which is quite easy to get rid of.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate fantastic however Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
