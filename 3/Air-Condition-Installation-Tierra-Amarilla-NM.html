<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based only on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday).

<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance products that only a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, however a homeowner does not have the skills or tools essential to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and proper air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, but property owners do not have the necessary equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still necessary to have a specialist technician check the system periodically.<p>
<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't offer off heat effectively and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur in time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick up until you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
<p>Heavy production industries employ a reasonably little portion of air conditioning technicians and other HVAC workers, however pay a few of the market's highest wages. Electrical power generating companies top the list, with a typical wage of $34.09 per hour or $70,920 annually. Auto parts producers, aerospace makers and automobile makers are all within a couple of cents of each other at roughly $31 per hour, or over $64,000 annually. Railways are another high-wage employer, at approximately $29.33 per hour or $61,000 annually.<p>
