<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
