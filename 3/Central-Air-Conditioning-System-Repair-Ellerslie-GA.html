<p>Many commercial structures use mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that become part of the heating and HVAC systems. Some structures can also utilize natural ventilation by opening doors or windows. The ventilation rate" is the quantity of outdoor air presented into an area per a system of time, and is typically expressed in cubic feet per minute (cfm). You can find the ASHRAE (American Society of Refrigerating, air-conditioning and heating Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for acceptable air quality online.<p>
<p>This is especially notable, as gas ranges can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to provide adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A common element essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
