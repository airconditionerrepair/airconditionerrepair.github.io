<p>A main factor in the prevention of health symptoms is an effective, effectively designed and running ventilation system. The ventilation system figures out the quality of the indoor air by managing the quantity of air that is added to the workplace environment, the cleanliness of such outside air, and the rate at which the office air and its pollutants are either exhausted to the re-circulated or outside throughout the structure.<p>
<p>We're spending a lot more time inside, these days. While many people assume pollution is just an outside problem, your home (and office) can also be contaminated. As a society, we make sure that our homes are well-insulated and well-sealed, however we do not believe sufficient about direct exposure to all the important things we position in our houses," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and structures has a huge effect on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, queasiness-- immediately, they can begin years after exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA).
