<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services in Mount Freedom NJ</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system. We chose getting something more pricey than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our most significant energy expenses. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not provide them.  Secondly like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary skills to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers relatively. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to effectively service and the unit has actually been running issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled.

Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
