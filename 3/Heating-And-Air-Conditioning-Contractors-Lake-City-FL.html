<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a damaging environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " top ecological danger to the health of children in the United States." There are many methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, degrading paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled, Airborne lead gets in the body.

<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can manage, many Seattleites need to discover methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in big box shops like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a terrible, cruel summer season.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas. Due to the fact that it is impossible to see, taste or smell, CO can eliminate you before you are aware it remains in your house. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO triggers mild results that are often mistaken for the flu. These symptoms consist of headaches, dizziness, disorientation, queasiness and fatigue. The effects of CO direct exposure can vary greatly from individual to individual depending upon age, general health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
