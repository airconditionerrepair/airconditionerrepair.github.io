<h3>The Advantages of Buying A New Furnace at Clarkston MI</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat distribution over the whole surface of a floor heats up the lower half of the space, covering residents in heat at a lower overall temperature-- in many cases as much as 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a conventional heating system." Simply put, in-floor heating unit provide a different mode and level of comfort. And, as various public awareness projects have long reminded us, the more comfortable we feel, the more inclined we may be to push down our thermostat, in turn lowering our energy expenditures.<p>
