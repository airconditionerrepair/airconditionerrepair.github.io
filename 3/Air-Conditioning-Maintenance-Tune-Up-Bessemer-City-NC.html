First, use exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, cabinets, and wall surface areas. Or, as an alternative, think about using solid wood products. Second of all, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, make sure that a reliable wetness barrier is installed prior to setting up the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed if it ends up being wet.<p>
