<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things initially. Make sure all the registers in the house are wide open.

The minimized airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's great airflow at the signs up.
