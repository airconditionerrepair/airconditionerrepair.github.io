<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.. Second of all like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to appropriately service and the unit has been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
