Though particular regulations have actually not been developed for IAQ in the work place, the Environment, Health and Safety Department (EHS) considers suggestions from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and A/c Engineers (ASHRAE).<p>

<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
