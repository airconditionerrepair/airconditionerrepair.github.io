Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again. He is sincere, reliable, and reasonable on rate. It's difficult to discover a truthful AC man and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
