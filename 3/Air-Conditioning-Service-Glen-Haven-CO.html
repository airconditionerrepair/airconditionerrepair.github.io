These computations consider things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is essential so the system isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump, in addition to all other kinds of heat pumps, have effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency, or POLICE. It's a clinical way of figuring out how much energy the system moves versus how much it uses. Many geothermal heatpump systems have Police officers of 3.0 to 5.0. This implies for every unit of energy used to power the system, three to 5 systems are provided as heat.<p>
