<p>A geothermal heat pump is one of the most energy efficient techniques of heating or cooling a house. Depending on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a house can be heated in cooler months by condensing and transferring energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels found just a few feet listed below ground.

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c unit into a heat pump While room cooling supplies maximum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is normally more pricey than central air.<p>
