During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, many of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may require a recommendation later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
