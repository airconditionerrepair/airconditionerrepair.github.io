<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do decline them until they have been appropriately dried. Try a various dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>

Before examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick up until you purchase a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
