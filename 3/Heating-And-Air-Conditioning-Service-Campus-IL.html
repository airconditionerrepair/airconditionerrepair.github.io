<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't produce heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur over time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts.
