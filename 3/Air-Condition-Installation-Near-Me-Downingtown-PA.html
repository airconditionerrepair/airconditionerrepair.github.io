<p>Indoor pollutants. These consist of chemicals used in the building or renovation of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook stoves, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor impurities.

Wood-burning stoves can likewise produce particulates and must be vented outside.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ may see unpleasant or musty odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from badly put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may get in nearby ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor water fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
