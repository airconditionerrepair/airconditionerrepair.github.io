<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the task based just on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday).

ProTex properly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up team was considerate of my home and set up the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up examination outcomes look very good for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 lot R22 system it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend utilized in automobiles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and utilized by licensed HVAC specialists. For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by many individuals.<p>

<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years earlier and understand the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
