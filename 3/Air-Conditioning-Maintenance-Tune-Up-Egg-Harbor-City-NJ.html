Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
