<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most furnaces have multiple control panel. The biggest, or only one in some furnaces, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the new control board should be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t effectively identified, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable when installed. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to identify.<p>
