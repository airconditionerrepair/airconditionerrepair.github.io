<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance in Philadelphia TN</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his assessment, guaranteeing I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
