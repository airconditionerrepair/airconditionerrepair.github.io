This figures out the heat gain your house goes through. The estimation is relatively easy to carry out and will expose what size unit you need. Carry on to another contractor if the one you're thinking about wants to determine the best system for your house exclusively on experience. Though strongly influenced by where you live, several factors affect the size system needed, consisting of the amount of wall and attic insulation you have; the types and placement of doors and windows; and the orientation of your house to the sun.
