<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The split system is the most typical. Many people are used to seeing this type in the yards of homes. With split system units, the majority of the parts are housed in a metal box outside of the home. Nevertheless, there are some internal components as well. Split systems are ideal for cooling numerous rooms simultaneously, but are not very energy effective. For that reason, one pro is not having loud equipment in the home. At the exact same time, the con would be that those who use this may invest more money on cooling costs in the long run because of the lower energy performance.<p>
