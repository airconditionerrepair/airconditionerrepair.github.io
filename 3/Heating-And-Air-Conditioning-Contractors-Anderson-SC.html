<h3>HVAC Repair And You What You Want to Know in Anderson SC</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. Sometimes, determined particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
