<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
