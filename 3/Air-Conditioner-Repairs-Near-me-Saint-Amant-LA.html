Lots of typical structure materials utilized prior to 1975 contain asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Usually, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling.
