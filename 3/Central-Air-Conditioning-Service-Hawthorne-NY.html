<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the prospective to adversely affect your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, germs, and extremely little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should examine and, if required, update the building envelope.
