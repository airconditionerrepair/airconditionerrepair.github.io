<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heater, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by distributing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

This in result injures your lorry's efficiency. A routine radiator flush is enough to keep the system fit. For this reason, make radiator flushing a part of your regular car maintenance schedule.
